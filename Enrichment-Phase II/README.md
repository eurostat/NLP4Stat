1. [**Phrase_Matcher_SE_OECD_ver1.ipynb**](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Enrichment-Phase%20II/Phrase_Matcher_SE_OECD_ver1.ipynb): Statistics Explained  articles and phrase matches with OECD's Glossary. Objective: to build a common vocabulary and construct "profiles" of the terms in this vocabulary. The output in the Jupyter notebook is temporarily unavailable due to a site failure at address https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/alpha.asp. See Excel output in [Phrase_Matcher_SE_OECD.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Enrichment-Phase%20II/Phrase_Matcher_SE_OECD.xlsx). Note that the code takes a rather long time to run.
2. [**Phrase_Matcher_SE_Eurostat_ver1.ipynb**](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Enrichment-Phase%20II/Phrase_Matcher_SE_Eurostat_ver1.ipynb): Similar work as in [1] with Eurostat's database of concepts and definitions. See also Excel output in [Phrase_Matcher_SE_Eurostat.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Enrichment-Phase%20II/Phrase_Matcher_SE_Eurostat.xlsx). Note that the code takes a rather long time to run.
