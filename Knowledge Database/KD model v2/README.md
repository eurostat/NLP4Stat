This folder contains:
*    The new ontology of the knowledge database in an OWL file: NLP4StatRef-Ontology-v2.3.owl
*    Another ontology which contains the hierarchy of the datasets in Eurostat's database: NLP4StatRef-Ontology-datasets-v2.3.owl
*    The latest documentation of the knowledge database: KD_Documentation_v2.3.docx. It includes the description of the two ontologies and the alignment with external Linked Open Data (LOD) vocabularies.

All the above are finalized, subject to minor changes.
