## Codes in folder NLP4Stat/Use Case A Widgets Demo

1. [**D_3_1_Use_Case_A_Version_3.ipynb**](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Use%20Case%20A%20Widgets%20Demo/D_3_1_Use_Case_A_Version_3.ipynb): A demonstration of the suitability of Jupyter notebooks together with **ipywidgets** for the implementation of the user interactions in Use Case A. This is a first version **not yet showing the layout enhancements which are possible and will be implemented with [Voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)**. 

Various scenarios are simulated with real data scraped and relations produced by topic modeling and subject-verb-object extraction. This code is part of Deliverable D3.1 “Design document for UC A. Inventory of approaches to explore, extract and connect information.”

Note: Please run all cells once. When the widgets are ready for use, the notebook will automatically hide all code, allowing experimentation.
