Use Case B - Faceted search. Work in progress, with inputs from the database (SE articles) except from one file (scraped categories per article - these are in the process of being transferred to the knowledge database). Among others, the code assigns the majority of the SE articles to themes and sub-themes.
* File [Use Case A Faceted search_v1.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/main/Use%20Case%20A%20Faceted%20search/Use%20Case%20A%20Faceted%20search_v1.ipynb): Please replace your user name and password in the command c = pyodbc.connect('DSN=Virtuoso All; DBA=ESTAT; UID=user_name; PWD=password'). 
* Interactive version of the above: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KSpiliop/Faceted/main?filepath=Use%20Case%20A%20Faceted%20search_v1.ipynb) **NOT YET WORKING** (to be fixed: unexplained failure to import pyodbc)
