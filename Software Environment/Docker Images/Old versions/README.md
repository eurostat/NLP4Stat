In this folder you will find two docker images:

- Virtuosodocker-compose.tar is the official Virtuoso image, where the default settings are implemented.
- virtuoso.tar.gz is the Kap Code installation image, it contains accounts for each team member and the password of the dba account has been changed. If necessary, it can be transferred. Due to size, this file is temporarily stored in a Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zH05XnbZXt01XdGUB3vjO8j-dzsuaAn3/view?usp=sharing).
