 ### Use Case D
  - This is a demonstration code showing the logic of the databot. The notebook is in Google Colab and requires a CUDA-enabled GPU.
  - It can be used in conversations for the identification of either datasets or SE Glossary articles. See instructions at the top on how to set this option.
  - The component for the identification of similar datasets or SE Glossary articles is based on the same S-BERT model used in Use Case C. See instructions on how to select the bi-encoder model.
  - The most time-consuming part is fine-tuning. This can be skipped if already run once.
