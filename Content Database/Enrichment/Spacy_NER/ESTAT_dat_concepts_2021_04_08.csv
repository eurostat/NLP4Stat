Intra-EU exports of goods    (or     dispatches    ) from a given Member State include goods destined for another Member State which:    are in free circulation; or     have been placed in the given Member State, under the customs procedures for inward processing or, until April 2016, for processing under customs control.    In     national accounts     exports consist of transactions in goods and services (sales, barter, gifts or grants) from     residents    to non-residents:    An export of a good occurs when there is a change of ownership from a resident to a non-resident. Also smuggled goods must be included in exports.     Change of ownership does not necessarily imply that the good in question physically crosses the frontier. If goods cross the border due to      financial leasing     , as      deliveries between affiliates of the same enterprise     or for      significant processing to order or repair     national accounts impute a change of ownership even though in legal terms no change of ownership takes place.     Export of services consist of all services rendered by residents to non-residents. In national accounts any direct purchases by non-residents in the      economic territory     of a country are recorded as exports of services; therefore all expenditure by foreign tourists in the economic territory of a country is considered as part of the exports of services of that country. Also international flows of illegal services must be included.     The      updated version of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008)     applies the principle of change in ownership universally; national accounts record goods sent abroad for/after processing to order as exports. Only the processing fee is recorded as an export of service of the economic territory where the processor is resident and as an import of service of the economic territory where the ordering party is resident.    Analogously, the national accounts' transactions in goods and services from non-residents to     residents    are     imports    .  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa5\xf0`\x8e \x00';

Permanent crops are usually ligneous crops, meaning trees or shrubs, not grown in rotation, but occupying the soil and yielding harvests for several (usually more than five) consecutive years.    Permanent crops are usually intended for human consumption and generally yield a higher added value per hectare than annual crops. They also play an important role in shaping the rural landscape (through orchards, vineyards and olive tree plantations) and helping to balance agriculture within the environment.    Orchards may be of the continuous type with minimum spacing between trees, or of the non-continuous type with wide spacing.

37;59;  The basic     Farm structure survey    , abbreviated as     FSS    and also known as     Survey on the structure of agricultural holdings    , is carried out by all     European Union (EU)    Member States. The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to     NUTS    3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a     census    .    The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia.    In 2010 a special survey, the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat.    The countries collect information from individual     agricultural holdings    and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to     Eurostat    . The information collected in the FSS covered     land use    , livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on     Farm structure survey - thresholds    .    The legal basis for the FSS was     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88    .

38;60;  The     Survey on agricultural production methods    , abbreviated as     SAPM    , is a once-only survey carried out in 2010 to collect data at farm level on agri-environmental measures.     European Union (EU)    Member States could choose whether to carry out the SAPM as a sample survey or as a     census    survey. Data were collected on tillage methods, soil conservation, landscape features, animal grazing, animal housing, manure application, manure storage and treatment facilities and irrigation. With reference to irrigation, Member States were asked to provide estimation (possibly by means of models) of the volume of water used for irrigation on the     agricultural holding    . Detailed information on the set up of the survey and the characteristics surveyed can be found in the background article on the     Survey on agricultural production methods    .    Bulgaria, Czechia, Romania, Montenegro, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Slovakia carried the SAPM out as a census survey, while Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia carried the SAPM out as a sample survey. Sample sizes varied from ca 3% to one-third of agricultural holdings. Though sample sizes may vary accross countries the level of precision is guaranteed for certain characteristics surveyed by the precision requirements laid down in Annex IV of     Regulation 1166/2008    .    The Member States collected information from individual agricultural holdings and, observing rules of confidentiality, data were transmitted to     Eurostat    . The results of the SAPM are linked at the level of individual agricultural holdings to the data obtained from the     Farm structure survey (FSS)    in 2010. The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (Member States, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the SAPM is the agricultural holding: a technical-economic unit, under single management, engaged in agricultural production. The SAPM covers all agricultural holdings with a     utilised agricultural area (UAA)    of at least one hectare (ha) and also those holdings with a UAA of less than 1 ha where their market production exceeds certain natural thresholds. The legal basis for the SAPM is Regulation 1166/2008 of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the Survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation 571/88    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dP\xd9\xaca \x00';

Loose housing may contain manure in the form of     solid dung and liquid manure    when there is a concrete floor which is cleaned more frequently by scraping may be provided in the area where the animals stand to feed and/or drink. It is common for a deep layer of bedding (usually straw) to be spread over the floor that is removed from the building, typically once or twice per winter, as farmyard manure.    Loose housing may also contain manure in the form of     slurry    when the manure and urine drop down below the floor into a pit, where they form slurry or where it may be scraped from concrete passageways and collected in storage tanks or lagoons, along with slurry deposited on outside yards.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x10i/\x9c \x00';

61;100;  For bovines, it is important to distinguish how much manure is deposited in the house and how much is deposited while grazing both for ammonia and for greenhouse gas emissions. Manure management is a continuum, so there is a need to take into account also different emissions during storage and spreading of solid and slurry management for the referred housing types.    The main types of cattle housing are:     Tied stalls      Loose and cubicle housing     Tied stalls    , also known as     stanchion-tied stables    , are     animal houses    where the animals are tied to their places and are not allowed to move freely. This has an impact on the ammonia emissions, as less area of the stable is soiled.    These types of housing can contain manure separated in the form of     solid dung    and     liquid manure    when the floors of the stalls are on sloping concrete with bedding (e.g. straw, chopped straw, sawdust) and a shallow gutter at the rear of the animals to collect part of the faeces and the urine, whilst part is regularly removed as solid manure. In some cases the gutter is equipped with a drainage pipe to collect seepage or there can be a deeper channel instead of a gutter to collect and store the liquid fraction. The manure is normally removed mechanically outside the building as     solid dung/farmyard manure    .    They can also contain manure in the form of     slurry    when the floors of the stalls are level concrete with a channel covered by a grid at the rear of the animals or fully slatted floor to collect faeces and urine as slurry. In this case, the manure and urine drop down below the floor into a pit, where they form slurry.    Loose housing    refers to animal houses where the animals are allowed to move freely and have free access over the whole area of the building or pen (a small enclosure for livestock).     Cubicle housing    is also included here. Cubicle houses are buildings divided into rows of individual stalls or cubicles in which animals lay when at rest but are not restrained.    Loose housing may contain manure in the form of     solid dung    and     liquid manure    when there is a concrete floor which is cleaned more frequently by scraping in the area where the animals stand to feed and/or drink. It is common for a deep layer of bedding (usually straw) to be spread over the floor. This bedding is removed from the building, typically once or twice per winter, as     farmyard manure    .    Loose housing may also contain manure in the form of     slurry    when the manure and urine drop down below the floor into a pit, where they form slurry or when it is scraped from concrete passageways and collected in storage tanks or lagoons.    Other types of housing    are types of housing different from the ones mentioned above. These include igloos and calf huts.    Outdoor    includes pasture, free range and paddock.    Exercise yards    are outdoor areas, normally with impermeable floor, where animals can exercise for part of the day. If an exercise yard exists on the holding, but the animals are not using it, then do not consider it.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x10\xf0Z\xed \x00';
62;101;"   Manure    (also known as     livestock manure    ) is organic matter, mostly derived from animal faeces and urine, but normally also containing plant material (often straw), which has been used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the faeces and urine. In the Nitrates Directive (     Council Directive 91/676/EEC    ), it is defined as ""waste products excreted by livestock or a mixture of litter and waste products excreted by livestock, even in processed form"".Dairy, beef and swine manure may be either solid or slurry. Horse and poultry manures are solid.    The distinction between solid manure, liquid manure and slurry is in part related to how they are handled in the farm. But the need to separate these different types while collecting Integrated Farm Statistics data is also related to their different chemical environments and consequent effect on emissions. When the conditions are insufficiently aerobic (for nitrification) or insufficiently anaerobic (for denitrification) nitrous oxide is likely to be formed. As liquid animal manure is a strict anaerobic substrate (due to its very low redox potential, its high biochemical oxygen demand and the slow oxygen diffusion into animal manure), nitrification cannot occur, apart from the superficial surface layer. As a result, nitrate is absent in liquid animal manure. Solid animal manure, on the other end, is accessible for diffusion of oxygen, so nitrification and denitrification will occur. Because nitrous oxyde production requires an initial aerobic reaction and then an anaerobic process, it is theorized that dry, aerobic management systems may provide an environment more conducive for nitrous oxyde production (     Jun et al.    , s.d.)    Solid manure    , including farmyard manure, are excrements, with or without litter, of domestic animals including possibly a small amount of urine. Solid manure has at least 20 % dry matter. It is handled with front-end loaders and/or pitchforks.    Farmyard manure    is a decomposed mixture of dung and urine with straw and litter used as bedding material and residues from the fodder fed to cattle, sheep and other livestock (excluding chicken). It is a form of solid manure.    Liquid manure    is urine from domestic animals including possibly a small amount of excrement and/or water. Liquid manure has up to 4 % dry matter and can be handled as a liquid with normal irrigation equipment. Liquid manure with less than 1 % solids (such as in properly designed anaerobic and aerobic lagoons) can be handled using conventional centrifugal pumps (     MWPS    , 2004).    Slurry    is manure in liquid form, a mixture of excrements and urine of domestic animals, including possibly also water and/or a small amount of litter.    Tree  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x85k\xdbg \x00';

Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as     million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents    , abbreviated as     MMTCDE    .    The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tonnes of the gas by the associated GWP:    MMTCDE = (million metric tonnes of a gas) * (GWP of the gas).    For example, the GWP for methane is 25 and for nitrous oxide 298. This means that emissions of 1 million metric tonnes of methane and nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 25 and 298 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x11\\\x02\xf2 \x00';

The     International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health    (ICF) is a framework for defining and measurement of functioning and disability. Disability is conceived as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between a person?s health condition(s) and that individual?s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).    There are different statistical and operational definitions of disability. Examples of four definitions used within the European Statistical System are provided here:    Disability measured through a concept of general activity limitation: ?Limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months? which is currently used in      European Health Interview Survey (EHIS)     and      EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)     . The indicator is based on data collected by the Global Activity Limitation Instrument (GALI): ?For at least the past 6 months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities people usually do? Would you say you have been ??severely limited / limited but not severely or / not limited at all??;     ?Disabled persons are persons whose longstanding health condition, illness, disease or longstanding difficulty with basic activities (such as seeing, hearing, concentrating, moving round) prevents them to participate in at least one life domain? which is used in the European Health and Social Integration Survey (EHSIS);     Disabled people are those persons having at least one basic activity difficulty (such as, seeing, hearing, walking, remembering, etc.) (see      Regulation (EU) No 317/2010     adopting the specifications of the 2011 ad hoc module on employment of disabled people for the labour force sample survey);     Disabled people (in employment) are those persons having a work limitation caused by a health problem and/or difficulty in a basic activity (see Regulation (EU) No 317/2010).     Disability pension    : periodic payments intended to maintain or support the income of someone below the legal or standard retirement age, as established in the reference scheme, who suffers from a disability which impairs his or her ability to work or earn above a minimum amount laid down by legislation.

Example of an operational definition used within the European Statistical System:    One question instrument ? the Global Activity Limitation Instrument (GALI) - assessing the presence of long-standing activity limitation: ?For at least the past 6 months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities people usually do? Would you say you have been ?? severely limited / limited but not severely or / not limited at all? The question was developed by the Euro-REVES project.

This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women, at birth and at ages 50 and 65. It is based on age-specific prevalence (proportions) of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition and age-specific     mortality    information. A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in functioning and without disability.    The indicator is calculated following the widely used     Sullivan method    . It is based on measures of the age-specific proportion of population with and without disability and on mortality data. Its interest lies in its simplicity, the availability of its basic data, and its independence of the size and age structure of the population.

The     International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health    (ICF) is a framework for defining and measurement of functioning and disability. Disability is conceived as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between a person?s health condition(s) and that individual?s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors).    There are different statistical and operational definitions of disability. Examples of four definitions used within the European Statistical System are provided here:    Disability measured through a concept of general activity limitation: ?Limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months? which is currently used in      European Health Interview Survey (EHIS)     and      EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)     . The indicator is based on data collected by the Global Activity Limitation Instrument (GALI): ?For at least the past 6 months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities people usually do? Would you say you have been ??severely limited / limited but not severely or / not limited at all??;     ?Disabled persons are persons whose longstanding health condition, illness, disease or longstanding difficulty with basic activities (such as seeing, hearing, concentrating, moving round) prevents them to participate in at least one life domain? which is used in the European Health and Social Integration Survey (EHSIS);     Disabled people are those persons having at least one basic activity difficulty (such as, seeing, hearing, walking, remembering, etc.) (see      Regulation (EU) No 317/2010     adopting the specifications of the 2011 ad hoc module on employment of disabled people for the labour force sample survey);     Disabled people (in employment) are those persons having a work limitation caused by a health problem and/or difficulty in a basic activity (see Regulation (EU) No 317/2010).

The equivalised disposable income is calculated in three steps:    all monetary incomes received from any source by each member of a household are added up; these include income from work, investment and social benefits, plus any other household income; taxes and social contributions that have been paid, are deducted from this sum;     in order to reflect differences in a household's size and composition, the total (net) household income is divided by the number of 'equivalent adults?, using a standard (equivalence) scale: the modified OECD scale; this scale gives a weight to all members of the household (and then adds these up to arrive at the      equivalised household size     ):      1.0 to the first adult;       0.5 to the second and each subsequent person aged 14 and over;       0.3 to each child aged under 14.      finally, the resulting figure is called the equivalised disposable income and is attributed equally to each member of the household.    For poverty indicators, the equivalised disposable income is calculated from the total disposable income of each household divided by the equivalised household size. The income reference period is a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year) for all countries except UK for which the income reference period is the current year and Ireland (IE) for which the survey is continuous and income is collected for the last twelve months.

Immigrant    is a person undertaking an immigration.    Emigration    is the action by which a person, having previously been usually resident in the territory of a Member State, ceases to have his or her usual residence in that Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Emigrant    is a person undertaking an emigration.    Net migration    is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. In the context of the annual demographic balance however, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and natural change; this concept is referred to as     net migration plus statistical adjustment    . The statistics on 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' are therefore affected by all the statistical inaccuracies in the two components of this equation, especially population change. From one country to another 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' may cover, besides the difference between inward and outward migration, other changes observed in the population figures between 1 January in two consecutive years which cannot be attributed to births, deaths, immigration and emigration.

Specifically, it is the difference in population size on 1 January of two consecutive years.    Population change has two components:     natural population change     (the number of      live births     minus the number of      deaths     );     net migration     (the number of      immigrants     minus the number of      emigrants     , plus statistical adjustment ? it should be noted that net migration as referred to in the context of population change statistics includes the statistical adjustments occurring in the annual balance of the population and that it serves the purpose of closing this balance).    A positive population change, when the result of net migration plus live births minus deaths is positive, is referred to as     population growth    , a negative one is called a     population decrease    .

It seeks to strengthen trade and economic relations between the contracting parties and is principally concerned with the four fundamental pillars of the internal market, namely: the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. The availability of comparable statistical data is considered as relevant to the four freedoms and is therefore included in the agreement.    EU enlargements    had a direct impact on the EEA Agreement, and the enlarged EEA now includes 30 countries (EFTA countries in italic):     Belgium      (BE)      Spain      (ES)      Hungary      (HU)      Slovakia      (SK)      Bulgaria      (BG)      France      (FR)      Malta      (MT)      Finland      (FI)      Czechia      (CZ)      Croatia      (HR)      Netherlands      (NL)      Sweden      (SE)      Denmark      (DK)      Italy      (IT)      Austria      (AT)      Germany      (DE)      Cyprus      (CY)      Poland      (PL)      Iceland      (       IS      )      Estonia      (EE)      Latvia      (LV)      Portugal      (PT)      Liechtenstein      (       LI      )      Ireland      (IE)      Lithuania      (LT)      Romania      (RO)      Norway      (       NO      )      Greece      (EL)      Luxembourg      (LU)      Slovenia      (SI)   ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x15\x85[\x89 \x00';

163;263;"  The     consumer price index    , abbreviated as     CPI    , measures the change over time in the prices of consumer goods and services acquired, used or paid for by     households    . It is an important measure of     inflation    in the     European Union (EU)    .    CPIs aim to cover the whole set of goods and services consumed within the territory of a country by the population. To do this, a representative set is selected; the so-called ?consumer basket?. Consumer goods and services include, for example, food and beverages, products for personal hygiene, newspapers and periodicals, expenditure on housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, health, transport, communications, education, restaurants and hotels.    Many of these goods and services are     bought frequently or consumed on a daily basis    .    CPIs may be used for a wide variety of purposes, including:    as a guide for monetary policy;     for the indexation of commercial contracts, wages, social protection benefits or financial instruments;     as a tool for      deflating     the      national accounts     or calculating changes in national consumption or living standards.     Eurostat    compiles     harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs)    to allow international comparisons of consumer price inflation. HICPs are used by the     European Central Bank    to monitor inflation in the     euro area    and to assess inflation convergence, as required under Article 121 of the     Treaty of Amsterdam    .

164;264;   Inflation    is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. When there is inflation in an economy, the value of money decreases because a given amount will buy fewer goods and services than before.    Inflation in an economy is often calculated by examining a basket of goods and services and comparing the changes in the prices of that basket over time.    The     inflation rate    is the percentage change in the price index for a given period compared to that recorded in a previous period. It is usually calculated on a year-on-year or annual basis.    For an index value of 183.1 for January of this year, and an index value of 178.4 recorded in January last year, the annual rate of inflation of January this year would be:    (183.1 / 178.4 ? 1) * 100 = 2.6 %    Similarly, one may compile month-on-month rates of change or average annual rates of change.    Deflation    is the opposite of inflation. It is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services and represents an increase in the value of money, where an amount of money can be exchanged for more goods and services.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x91\xdb \xbf \x00';
165;266;  The     European currency unit    , abbreviated as     ECU    , was the former currency unit of the European Communities, from its adoption on 13 March 1979 (replacing the 'European Unit of Account') to its own replacement by the     euro    on 1 January 1999, at a ratio of 1:1. The ECU was composed of a basket of currencies of the European Communities Member States and it served as the standard monetary unit of measurement of the market value/cost of goods, services, or assets in the European Communities, thus constituting the cornerstone of the     European Monetary System (EMS)    .    Apart from the official role in the EMS, a private market for the ECU also developed, allowing its use in monetary transactions and for denominating financial instruments including bonds. A major advantage for investors was that securities denominated in ECUs made foreign diversification possible without reliance on the currency of a single country.    Unlike the euro, the ECU was only an electronic unit of account without any official coins or notes that could be used for cash transactions.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x15\xad\x8fv \x00';

Together these Member States make up the     euro area    .    Stage III of     economic and monetary union (EMU)    began on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the euro, which replaced the     European currency unit (ECU)    on a 1:1 basis. On that date, the national currencies of 11 EU Member States (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland) were fixed to the euro at irrevocable     conversion rates    . Greece joined them on 1 January 2001.    Until the end of 2001, the euro existed as book money only (cheque, bank transfer, payment by card) and its use was voluntary (no compulsion ? no prohibition). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002, when use of the euro became compulsory and national currencies were progressively withdrawn.

167;268;  The     European Monetary System    , abbreviated as     EMS    , was an exchange rate regime set up in 1979 (and which ended in 1999) to foster closer monetary policy co-operation between the central banks of the Member States of the European Economic Community (EEC). The objective of the EMS was to promote monetary stability in Europe.    The European Monetary System was built on the concept of stable but adjustable exchange rates defined according to the newly created     European currency unit (ECU)    ? a currency basket based on a weighted average of EMS currencies. Within the EMS, currency fluctuations were controlled through the     Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)    .    The EMS was a radical new departure because exchange rates could only be changed by mutual agreement between participating Member States and the     European Commission    ? an unprecedented pooling of monetary sovereignty. It was replaced by     ERM II    (exchange rate mechanism II) at the start of Stage Three of     economic and monetary union (EMU)    on 1 January 1999 when the single currency was launched.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dDU!\xeb \x00';
168;269;  Health interview surveys offer comprehensive data on the health status of a population and health-related topics based on answers by respondents of a representative sample of the population. The European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) includes information from all     European Union (EU)    Member States and is to be conducted every five years according to the     Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008    on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work.    The first wave of EHIS was conducted under a gentlemen?s agreement and implemented in 17 Member States between 2006 and 2009. EHIS wave 2 is conducted in all EU Member States between 2013 and 2015 according to the     Regulation (EU) No 141/2013    as regards statistics based on the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS).    EHIS covers the following topics:    Health status (self-perceived health, chronic diseases, limitation in activities, mental health, pain, accidents, etc.)     Health determinants (smoking and alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, dietary habits, etc.)     Health care (use of different types of health care services including hospitalizations, consultations, prevention, use of medicines but also unmet needs for health care).    EHIS is used as a data source for important health and social policy indicators such as the     European Core Health Indicators (ECHI)    or indicators of the health and long-term care strand developed under the Open Method of Coordination on social protection and social inclusion (     EU social indicators    ).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x15\xbeC\xeb \x00';

It is used for policy monitoring within the '     Open method of coordination (OMC)    '.    EU-SILC was launched in 2003 on the basis of a gentlemen's agreement between     Eurostat    and six Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg) and Norway. It was formally launched in 2004 in fifteen countries and expanded in 2005 to cover all of the then     EU-25    Member States, together with Norway and Iceland. Bulgaria launched EU-SILC in 2006 while Romania, Switzerland and Turkey introduced the survey in 2007. EU-SILC provides two types of annual data:    cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions;     longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period.    EU-SILC is a multi-purpose instrument which focuses mainly on income. Detailed data are collected on income components, mostly on personal income, although a few     household    income components are included. However, information on social exclusion, housing conditions, labour, education and health information is also obtained.    EU-SILC is based on the idea of a common ?framework? and no longer a common ?survey?. The common framework defines    the harmonised lists of target primary (annual) and secondary (every four years or less frequently) variables to be transmitted to Eurostat;     common guidelines and procedures;     common concepts (household and income) and classifications aimed at maximising comparability of the information produced.    The reference population in EU-SILC includes all     private households    and their current members residing in the territory of the countries at the time of data collection. Persons living in     collective households    and in institutions are generally excluded from the target population. Some small parts of the national territory amounting to no more than 2 % of the national population and the national territories may be excluded from EU-SILC. All household members are surveyed, but only those aged 16 and more are interviewed.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dC7@[ \x00';

Environmental accounts serve as a basis for the analyses of environmental impact of economic activity and policy measures, plus social activity. They allow calculating environmental footprints, environmental intensities or productivities by industries, the parts of the economy, which are ?green? or ?greener?

These material flows comprise the extraction of materials inside the economy and the physical imports and exports (i.e. the mass weight of goods imported or exported). Air and water are generally excluded.    Domestic extraction    is the amount of raw material (excluding water and air), in physical weight, extracted from the natural environment for use in the economy.    Physical imports    are the imports into the economy, in physical weight    Direct material input    (     DMI)    is the input of materials for use in an economy, in other words, all materials which are of economic value and which are availlible for use in production and consumption activities.    Physical exports    are the exports from the economy into other economies, in physical weight    Domestic material consumption    (     DMC)    , measures the total amount of materials used by an economy and is defined as the quantity of raw materials extracted from the domestic territory, plus all physical imports minus all physical exports.    Direct material input = Domestic extraction + Physical imports     Domestic material consumption = Domestic extraction + Physical imports - Physical exports    = Direct material input - Physical exports    The simple weight of traded goods provides an incomplete picture as it does not take into account the raw materials originally necessary to produce these traded goods. A more comprehensive picture on the ?material footprints? can be obtained by converting the traded goods into their     raw material equivalents (RME),    i.e. the amounts of raw materials required to provide the respective traded goods. Especially for finished and semi-finished products, imports and exports in RME are much higher than their corresponding physical weight.    Imports in RME    are the amount of raw material required to produce the goods imported into the economy    Exports in RME    are the amount of raw material required to produce the goods exported from the economy    Raw material input    (     RMI)    is the amount of raw materials required to produce the goods which are available for use in production and consumption activities of the economy.    Raw material consumption (RMC)    , measures the total amount of raw materials required to produce the goods used by the economy (also called 'material footprint').    Raw material input = Domestic extraction + Imports in RME     Raw material consumption = Domestic extraction + Imports in RME - Exports in RME = Raw material input - Exports in RME  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x85\x139\xcb \x00';

Its major objective is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment in the     European Union    , by increasing knowledge about the hazardous properties of chemicals. The REACH Regulation puts greater responsibility on industry to manage the risks that chemicals may pose to health and the environment.    The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and earlier identification of the hazardous properties of chemical substances, while at the same time enhancing the innovative capacity and     competitiveness    of the EU chemical industry. The benefits of the REACH system will come gradually, as more and more substances are phased into this Regulation. The Regulation also calls for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dm{\x0e\x92 \x00';

189;301;"  The     EU statistics on income and living conditions    , abbreviated as     EU-SILC    , is the reference source for comparative statistics on income distribution and social inclusion in the     European Union (EU)    . It is used for policy monitoring within the '     Open method of coordination (OMC)    '.    EU-SILC was launched in 2003 on the basis of a gentlemen's agreement between     Eurostat    and six Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg) and Norway. It was formally launched in 2004 in fifteen countries and expanded in 2005 to cover all of the then     EU-25    Member States, together with Norway and Iceland. Bulgaria launched EU-SILC in 2006 while Romania, Switzerland and Turkey introduced the survey in 2007. EU-SILC provides two types of annual data:    cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions;     longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period.    EU-SILC is a multi-purpose instrument which focuses mainly on income. Detailed data are collected on income components, mostly on personal income, although a few     household    income components are included. However, information on social exclusion, housing conditions, labour, education and health information is also obtained.    EU-SILC is based on the idea of a common ?framework? and no longer a common ?survey?. The common framework defines    the harmonised lists of target primary (annual) and secondary (every four years or less frequently) variables to be transmitted to Eurostat;     common guidelines and procedures;     common concepts (household and income) and classifications aimed at maximising comparability of the information produced.    The reference population in EU-SILC includes all     private households    and their current members residing in the territory of the countries at the time of data collection. Persons living in     collective households    and in institutions are generally excluded from the target population. Some small parts of the national territory amounting to no more than 2 % of the national population and the national territories may be excluded from EU-SILC. All household members are surveyed, but only those aged 16 and more are interviewed.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x16\xbbo\x0c \x00';
190;304;"  The     European Union institutions    , sometimes abbreviated as     EUI    , comprises three main     European Union (EU)    institutions:    The      European Parliament (EP)     , which represents EU citizens and is directly elected by them;     The      Council of the European Union     , which represents the individual Member States;     The      European Commission (EC)     , which seeks to uphold the interests of the Union as a whole.    The European Union (EU) is not a federation like the United States, nor is it simply an organisation for co-operation between governments, like the     United Nations (UN)    ; it is, in fact, unique. The countries that make up the EU (its Member States) remain independent sovereign nations but they pool their sovereignty in order to gain the strength and world influence none of them could have on their own.Pooling sovereignty means, in practice, that the Member States delegate some of their decision-making powers to shared institutions they have created, so that decisions on specific matters of joint interest can be made democratically at European level.    The EU's     decision-making process    in general and the     co-decision procedure    in particular involve the three main institutions. This ?institutional triangle? produces the policies and laws that apply throughout the EU. In principle, it is the Commission that proposes new laws, but it is the Parliament and Council that adopt them. The Commission and the Member States then implement them, and the Commission ensures that the laws are properly taken onboard.    Two other institutions have a vital part to play: the     Court of Justice    upholds the rule of European law, and the     Court of Auditors    checks the financing of the Union?s activities.    The powers and responsibilities of these institutions are laid down in the Treaties, which are the foundation of everything the EU does. They also lay down the rules and procedures that the EU institutions must follow. The Treaties are agreed by the presidents and/or prime ministers of all the EU countries, and ratified by their parliaments.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x16\xcc\x04\x92 \x00';

It represents a new stage in European integration since it opens the way to political integration, by creating a     European Union    consisting of three pillars:    the European Communities;     Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP);     police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (JHA).    The Treaty introduces the concept of European citizenship, reinforces the powers of the     European Parliament    and launches     economic and monetary union    . Besides, the EEC becomes the European Community (EC).    Amendments were made to the Treaty of Maastricht by:    the      Treaty of Amsterdam     (1997), which increased the powers of the Union by creating a Community employment policy, transferring to the Communities some of the areas which were previously subject to intergovernmental cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs, introducing measures aimed at bringing the Union closer to its citizens and enabling closer cooperation between certain Member States (enhanced cooperation).

It was established to safeguard sound public finances, an important requirement for EMU to function properly. The SGP consists of a preventive and a dissuasive arm.    The SGP has to be seen against the background of Stage III of economic and monetary union, which began on 1 January 1999. Its aim is to ensure that the Member States continue their budgetary discipline efforts once the euro has been introduced.    The pact stems from a     European Council    resolution (adopted at Amsterdam on 17 June 1997) and two Council regulations of 7 July 1997 laying down detailed technical arrangements, one on the surveillance of budgetary positions and coordination of economic policies and the other on implementing the     Excessive deficit procedure    .    In the medium term, the euro-area Member States undertake to achieve a balanced or nearly balanced budget and to give the Council and the     European Commission    a stability programme every year. Along the same lines, Member States outside the euro area are required to submit a     convergence programme    .    The Stability and growth pact opens the way for the Council to penalise any euro area Member State that fails to take appropriate measures to end an excessive     deficit    . Initially, thepenalty takes the form of a non-interest bearing deposit with the EU, but it could be converted into a fine if the excessive deficit is not corrected within two years.  ;0;0;"b""\x0bBN\x8dc'\x13q \x00""";

207;332;   European size unit    , abbreviated as     ESU    , is a     standard gross margin    of EUR 1 200 that is used to express the economic size of an     agricultural holding    or farm.    For each activity (or 'enterprise') on a farm (for example wheat production,     dairy cows    or the output from a vineyard), the standard gross margin (SGM) is estimated based on the area used for the particular activity (or the number of heads of livestock) and a regional coefficient. The sum of all such margins derived from activities on a particular farm is its     economic size    , which is then expressed in European size units (by dividing the total SGM in euro by 1200, thus converting it to ESU).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x17\xa4\xccm \x00';
208;334;  The     standard gross margin    , abbreviated as     SGM    , is a measure of the production or the business size of an     agricultural holding    . It is based on the separate activities or 'enterprises' of a farm and their relative contribution to overall revenue.For each separate activity (for instance wheat,     dairy cows    or a vineyard), a SGM is estimated, based on the area (for     crop output    ) or the number of heads (for     animal output    ) and a standardised SGM coefficient for each type of crop and livestock, calculated separately for different geographical areas to allow for differences in profit. The sum of all these margins per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall economic size, expressed in     European size units    or ESU - 1 ESU is a 1200 euro SGM.    SGMs represent the level of profit to be expected on the average farm under 'normal' conditions (discounting, for example, disease outbreaks, fires and floods, adverse weather). The standard gross margin (SGM) for a farm is the difference between the gross production (to which subsidies are added) and the variable specific costs.    The definition and principles for calculating SGM coefficients can be found in Annex I to     Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985    , listing also the types of farming or the farm structure characteristics to be used. On a farm, the share of each separate activity in the total SGM of a farm enables to classify the farm in one of the types of farming defined by the legislation. For instance, if the share of olive trees in the total SGM is over 2/3, the farm is taken as specialist olives.    Since 1985, the typology of the agricultural holdings was based on SGMs calculated taking into account the gross output and the subsidies, as well as certain deductible specific costs. In the meantime the common agricultural policy has drasticallychanged and the majority of the direct payments has been decoupled. Due to this decoupling of direct payments since 2005, it was not possible to maintain the previous typology (Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985) based on SGM. A SGM without subsidies could be negative and therefore can not be used as classification criteria. Therefore, a new typology has been established.    From FSS 2010 onward the SGM has been replaced by     standard output    (abbreviated as SO) according to the     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014    of 1 August 2014 supplementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Union) repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008).

212;341;  An enterprise is an organisational unit producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than one location. An enterprise may consist out of one or more legal units.    Legal units include legal persons whose existence is recognized by law independently of the individuals or institutions which may own them or are members of them, such as general partnerships, private limited partnerships, limited liability companies, incorporated companies etc. Legal units as well include natural persons who are engaged in an economic activity in their own right, such as the owner and operator of a shop or a garage, a lawyer or a     self-employed    handicrafts-man.    Most enterprises consist out of one legal unit. According to     Eurostat    estimations only a very small share of enterprises comprise more than one legal unit. However, in terms of     employment    or     value added    these enterprises cover a huge part of the economy. Many of the big companies quoted at the stock exchange are on top of a chain of control of a big number of legal units.    A legal unit may own a second legal unit and this second legal unit may carry out activities solely for this first legal unit. E.g. legal unit A, a limited liability, produces particular goods and legal unit B, a limited liability as well, solely sells these goods. Both units have the same management. In this case they are seen as one single enterprise. Another example may be that legal unit C employs the staff and legal unit D owns the means of production like machines and buildings. A third legal unit E may own and manage these two legal units. Only the units C, D and E together can produce something and hence are to be counted as one enterprise.    Reasons for splitting the organisational unit enterprise into more than one legal unit can be manifold: avoiding taxes or liabilities, different salaries according to the collective wage agreement or avoiding the publication of annual reports are among them. For example, an enterprise with a certain activity might be able to save expenses, if the wages in the collective wage agreement of this activity are higher than e.g. in logistics. In that case it could make sense to single out the transport capacities of this enterprise into a special limited liability. While in the practical organisation of the enterprise nothing has changed, it now legally consists out of two legal units.    In parallel globalisation has contributed further to more complex structures of enterprises. Being active on a market in a country very often requires an enterprise to have a legal unit in that country. The legal units of such an enterprise may be centrally managed from one country, the book-keeping may be carried out centrally from another country, R&D may be done in a country with high wages, parts of the production in countries with low wages. European business statistics serves European and national purposes, data collection in the     European Statistical System    is organised nationally. In this set-up only the national parts of a multi-national enterprise are registered in statistics and their European parts have to be aggregated to obtain European aggregates. Multi-national enterprises are often very big enterprises with a huge impact on statistics in terms of     employment    and     value added    . Thus, a good quality of multi-national enterprise data is crucial for a good quality of European business statistics and necessitates a stepping-up of the collaboration among the     European Statistical System    . This collaboration is organised in the form of European     profiling    , a process to delineate complex and large enterprises.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x1bC\x98. \x00';

217;347;"  The     European system of integrated social protection statistics    , abbreviated as     ESSPROS    , is a common framework developed in the late 1970's by     Eurostat    and the     European Union (EU)    Member States providing a coherent comparison between European countries of     social benefits    to     households    and their financing, thus making an international comparison of the administrative national data on     social protection    possible.    ESSPROS is built on the concept of social protection, or the coverage of precisely defined risks and needs including health, disability, old age, family and     unemployment    ; it records the receipts and the expenditure of the organizations or schemes involved in social protection interventions.    ESSPROS is composed of the     core system    and of     modules    . The core system contains two types of annual data (collected by Eurostat from 1990 on):     quantitative data     : social protection receipts and expenditures by schemes (a distinct body of rules, supported by one or more institutional units, governing the provision of social protection benefits and their financing);     qualitative data     : metadata by scheme and detailed benefit.    Social protection benefits are transfers to households, in cash or in kind, intended to relieve them from the financial burden of a number of risks or needs. The risks or needs of social protection included in ESSPROS are disability, sickness/healthcare, old age, survivors, family/children, unemployment, housing and social exclusion not elsewhere classified.    The modules contain supplementary statistical information on particular aspects of social protection: they relate to pensions' beneficiaries and to net social benefits.    Under ESSPROS, the     expenditure    of social protection is classified by type, indicating the nature of, or the reason for, the expenditure:     social protection benefits     ;     administration costs;     transfers to other schemes;     other expenditure.    Social benefits can be further broken down by type or by function:     type     refers to the form in which benefits are provided, for example in cash or in kind;     social protection      functions     refer to the needs covered by benefits: thus, income maintenance can be paid in with regard to health, but also disability, old age, maternity or unemployment.    Receipts of social protection schemes are classified by type or by origin:    the      type     gives the nature of, or the reason for a payment:      social contributions     , general government contributions, transfers from other schemes and other receipts;     the      origin     specifies the      institutional sector     from which the payment is received:      all        resident institutional units       :        corporations;         general government         ;         household sector         ;         non-profit institutions serving households         ;        rest of the world.

Five separate confidence indicators are produced, for industry, construction, services, retail trade and consumers. Each confidence indicator is calculated as the simple     arithmetic average    of the (     seasonally adjusted    ) balances of positive and negative answers to specific questions, e.g. regarding economic expectations.    In order to be able to track overall economic activity, a broader     economic sentiment indicator (ESI)    is calculated as a composite indicator of these confidence indicators.

231;372;   Short-term business statistics    , or simply     short-term statistics    , abbreviated as     STS    , are a set of indicators, usually with a monthly or quarterly frequency, used for closely tracking the     business cycle    of an economy (a single country, the     European Union    or the     euro area    ). In order to be relevant, they have to reflect current developments with the shortest possible delays.    STS indicators are important tools for formulating and monitoring economic and monetary policies. They are in great demand by policy makers (national and regional governments), the     European Commission    , central banks (particularly the     European Central Bank    ), private     enterprises    , professional organizations and financial markets.    The indicators covered by STS are for example     production    , turnover, hours worked, number of people employed, gross wages and producer prices. They are collected for the all major sectors of the market economy (industry, construction, trade and services).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8df:x_ \x00';

It funds a range of activities, particularly in support of adult learning staff to travel to other European countries for learning experiences, through exchanges and various other professional experiences. Other examples of large-scale initiatives involve networking and partnerships between organisations in different countries.    Specific objectives are:    increasing the number of people in adult education to 25 000 by 2013, and improve the quality of their experience, whether at home or abroad;     improving conditions for mobility so that at least 7 000 people per year by 2013 can benefit from adult education abroad;     improving the quality and amount of co-operation between adult education organisations;     developing innovative adult education and management practices, and encourage widespread implementation;     ensuring that people on the margins of society have access to adult education, especially older people and those who left education without basic qualifications;     supporting innovative ICT-based educational content, services and practices.

243;398;   Lifelong learning    encompasses all learning activities undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences, within personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or aim to learn is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sporting activities.    Adult learning    means the participation of adults in lifelong learning. Adult learning usually refers to learning activities after the end of     initial education     and is a vital component of the EU?s lifelong learning policy. The main indicator to measure adult learning is the participation rate in education and training, which covers participation in formal and non-formal education and training. The target population of Eurostat?s adult learning statistics is the population aged 25-64. Two main data sources are available for adult participation in learning:    the EU      labour force survey      which provides data on participation in formal and non-formal education and training in the last four weeks, and     the      adult education survey      which provides information on participation in formal and non-formal education and training as well as on informal learning in the last 12 months.

266;433;  The     European Neighbourhood Policy    , abbreviated as     ENP    , was developed in 2004, with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the     enlarged     European Union (EU)    and its neighbours to the South and East.    Through the ENP, the EU offers its neighbours a privileged relationship, building upon a mutual commitment to common values (democracy and human rights, rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and     sustainable development    ). The ENP goes beyond existing relationships to offer a deeper political relationship and economic integration. The central element of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the bilateral ENP Action Plans agreed between the EU and each partner. These plans set out an agenda of political and economic reforms with short and medium-term priorities.    With the Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Relationship Summit in May 2009, the EU and its eastern partners committed to a deeper bilateral engagement, the main goal of which will be to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the EU and interested partner countries through ?New Association Agreements?.

269;438;   Energy intensity    is one of the indicators to measure the energy needs of an economy. It is often used as an approximation of energy efficiency. Many factors influence energy intensity. It reflects on structure of economy and its cycle, general standards of living and weather conditions in the reference area.    Energy intensity is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP. Indicator expressed in chain linked volumes is more suitable to be used to compare different time periods in one country, while PPS values are more suitable to be used to compare across countries in one specific year.

270;439;"   Gross inland energy consumption    , sometimes abbreviated as     gross inland consumption    , is the total energy demand of a country or region. It represents the quantity of energy necessary to satisfy inland consumption of the geographical entity under consideration.    Gross inland energy consumption covers:    consumption by the energy sector itself;     distribution and transformation losses;     final energy consumption     by end users;     'statistical differences' (not already captured in the figures on primary energy consumption and final energy consumption).    Gross inland consumption does not include energy (fuel oil) provided to     international maritime bunkers    . It is calculated as follows:     primary production +        recovered products       + net imports + variations of stocks ? bunkers.     The difference between gross inland energy consumption and     gross (energy) consumption    is that in gross energy consumption the transformation output (electricity or heat produced from other energy sources) is included.

The objective of the EMS was to promote monetary stability in Europe.    The European Monetary System was built on the concept of stable but adjustable exchange rates defined according to the newly created     European currency unit (ECU)    ? a currency basket based on a weighted average of EMS currencies. Within the EMS, currency fluctuations were controlled through the     Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)    .    The EMS was a radical new departure because exchange rates could only be changed by mutual agreement between participating Member States and the     European Commission    ? an unprecedented pooling of monetary sovereignty. It was replaced by     ERM II    (exchange rate mechanism II) at the start of Stage Three of     economic and monetary union (EMU)    on 1 January 1999 when the single currency was launched.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x1c\x05\xf9\xdb \x00';

All Member States are expected to participate in EMU and all, except Denmark, have committed themselves by treaty to join EMU.

After the euro?s introduction on 1 January 1999, the original ERM was replaced by ERM II (Exchange rate mechanism II) at the start of Stage Three of     economic and monetary union (EMU)    .

Within the context of     structural business statistics    , an     employee    is a person who works for an employer on the basis of a contract of employment and receives     compensation    in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, piecework pay or remuneration in kind.    The contract is an agreement between an enterprise (the employer) and a person (the employee), which may be formal or informal, normally entered into voluntarily by both parties, whereby the person works for the enterprise in return for compensation in cash or in kind.    A worker is considered to be an employee of a particular unit if he or she receives a wage or salary from the unit regardless of where the work is performed (even from remote locations). A worker from a temporary employment agency is considered to be the agency's employee and not that of the business unit to which he or she is assigned.    In particular, the following categories are also considered employees:    paid working      proprietors     ;     students     formally committed to contribute to a unit?s production in return for remuneration and/or education services;     employees      engaged under a contract specifically designed to encourage the recruitment of unemployed persons     ;     homeworkers     if there is an explicit agreement that the persons are remunerated on the basis of the work done at home and if they are included on the payroll.    Part-time workers, seasonal workers, persons on strike or on short-term leave are all considered employees, while volunteers or workers on long-term leave are excluded.

321;515;   Electronic data interchange    , abbreviated as EDI, is the exchange of data in electronic format, usually compatible between sender and receiver. EDI offers businesses the opportunity to retrieve information electronically from their internal systems and to send that information to trade partners/suppliers/customers/government through a communications network. An example might be putting data from one type of database management system into a sequential format and then moving the data to a second location where they are stored in a format different from the original database management system.    Using EDI, business data is exchanged from one computer to another in a standard format. The information is organised to allow a fully automated computer transaction that needs no human intervention during the whole process. The information that is contained in an EDI document is the same as that in a conventional hard copy (printed document).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x1e{\xaf\x8a \x00';
322;516;  The     European currency unit    , abbreviated as     ECU    , was the former currency unit of the European Communities, from its adoption on 13 March 1979 (replacing the 'European Unit of Account') to its own replacement by the     euro    on 1 January 1999, at a ratio of 1:1. The ECU was composed of a basket of currencies of the European Communities Member States and it served as the standard monetary unit of measurement of the market value/cost of goods, services, or assets in the European Communities, thus constituting the cornerstone of the     European Monetary System (EMS)    .    Apart from the official role in the EMS, a private market for the ECU also developed, allowing its use in monetary transactions and for denominating financial instruments including bonds. A major advantage for investors was that securities denominated in ECUs made foreign diversification possible without reliance on the currency of a single country.    Unlike the euro, the ECU was only an electronic unit of account without any official coins or notes that could be used for cash transactions.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x1e\x90\xc9| \x00';

The procedure entails several steps, potentially culminating in sanctions, to encourage a Member State to get its budget deficit under control, a requirement for the smooth functioning of     Economic and monetary union (EMU)    .    According to the ""Protocol on the Excessive deficit procedure"", annexed to the     Maastricht Treaty    on economic and monetary union, Member States in the     euro area    and euro area candidate countries must demonstrate sound public finances. There are two criteria:    the budget deficit must not exceed 3 % of      gross domestic product (GDP)     ;     public debt     must not exceed 60 % of GDP.    For the sake of comparability between Member States, these criteria are measured on the basis of two economic categories from the     national accounts    framework:     net lending and net borrowing     ;     gross debt at face value - including liabilities of      general government     in the following financial instruments: currency and deposits, debt securities and loans.    As part of the procedure and on the basis of     Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009    as amended by     Commission Regulation (EU) No 220/2014    , all Member States are requested to report their data to     Eurostat    before 1 April and 1 October each year. Following assessment of the quality of deficit and debt data provided and their compliance with national accounts rules (     European system of national and regional accounts    ), Eurostat publishes, within three weeks after the deadline, the notified government deficit and debt data by way of a news release. When Eurostat has doubts on the quality of reported data, it may express reservations on the data of the Member State concerned.

The sectors of an economy are composed of two main types of institutional units:     households     and individuals who make up a household;     legal and social entities, such as corporations and quasi-corporations (e.g. branches of foreign direct investors), non-profit institutions, and the government of that economy.    These institutional units must meet certain criteria to be considered resident units of the economy.    Residence is a particularly important attribute of an institutional unit in the     balance of payments    because the identification of transactions between residents and non-residents underpins the system. Residence is also important in national accounts because the residency status of producers determines the limits of domestic production and affects the measurements of     gross domestic product (GDP)    and many important flows.    The concept of residence is based on a sectoral transactor's centre of economic interest. It is necessary to recognise the economic territory of a country as the relevant geographical area to which the concept of residence is applied. An institutional unit is a resident unit when it has a centre of economic interest in the economic territory of a country.    The institutional unit is an elementary economic decision-making centre characterised by similarity of behaviour and decision-making autonomy in the exercise of its main function. A resident unit is regarded as constituting an institutional unit if it has decision-making autonomy for its main function and either keeps a complete set of accounts or it would be possible and meaningful, from both an economic and legal viewpoint, to make a complete set of accounts if they were needed.

For each activity (or 'enterprise') on a farm (for example wheat production,     dairy cows    or the output from a vineyard), the standard gross margin (SGM) is estimated based on the area used for the particular activity (or the number of heads of livestock) and a regional coefficient. The sum of all such margins derived from activities on a particular farm is its     economic size    , which is then expressed in European size units (by dividing the total SGM in euro by 1200, thus converting it to ESU).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x1f\x12,\x92 \x00';

Since 2001, EMAS has been open to all economic sectors, including public and private services.

As a future CAP innovation, eco-schemes shall provide support for farmers who observe agricultural practices beneficial for the environment and climate. It is a measure to reward and incentivise farmers for taking action towards a more sustainable farm and land management with the objective to maintain public goods. The participation for farmers is voluntary. Member States are however obliged to include one or more eco-schemes in their CAP Strategic Plans (CSPs). Nevertheless, it offers more flexibility comparing to the current greening payments of the CAP as Member States are free to set the scheme?s content and budget.

Although the structure of EAA matches very closely that of     national accounts    , their compilation requires the formulation of appropriate rules and methods.    The EAA analyse the production processes of the agricultural sector and the primary income generated by these activities. The accounts are therefore based on the industry concept.

362;587;   Early warning system    refers to a set of economic indicators (hard, soft, non-conventional) that give an advance notice of an incident. It is intended to detect any possible movements in economic phenomena (e.g.     business cycle    , turning points) as early as possible.    The difference between an early warning system and a     leading indicator    is that the former is composed of many variables whose role can change over different phases in time. A leading indicator provides signs of the recurrent movements in an economy. On the other hand, an early warning system often includes a network of indicators, depending on the circumstances or the position in the business cycle, some of which can indicate certain aspects of the future movements in economic phenomena.

Although the structure of EAA matches very closely that of     national accounts    , their compilation requires the formulation of appropriate rules and methods.    The EAA analyse the production processes of the agricultural sector and the primary income generated by these activities. The accounts are therefore based on the industry concept. The agricultural sector, as described in the EAA, corresponds to Division 01 in     NACE    Rev. 1 ""Agriculture, hunting and related service activities"".    The EAA measure the total output of the agricultural activity which includes:    output sold (including trade in agricultural goods and services between agricultural units);     changes in stocks;     output for own final consumption and own-account gross-fixed capital formation;     output produced for further processing by other agricultural producers;     intra-unit consumption of livestock feed products.    The agricultural industry's output equals the sum of the ouput of agricultural products plus goods and services produced in non-agricultural secondary activities.

382;612;"   Asylum applicant    refers to a person having submitted an     application for international protection    or having been included in such application as a family member during the reference period.    In deciding when to regard an asylum application as having been lodged, the principles expressed in     Council Regulation (EU) 604/2013    should be applied, i.e. ""An application for international protection shall be deemed to have been lodged once a form submitted by the applicant or a report prepared by the authorities has reached the competent authorities of the Member State concerned. Where an application is not made in writing, the time elapsing between the statement of intention and the preparation of a report should be as short as possible"".    Applications submitted by persons who are subsequently found to be a subject of a     Dublin procedure    are included in the number of asylum applications. Within the same reference period every person being a subject of asylum application is counted only once, therefore     repeat applications    are not recorded if the first application has been lodged in the same reference period. However, such a repeat application will be recorded if lodged in a different reference month. It means that the aggregation of the monthly figures may overestimate the number of persons applying for international protection within the aggregated period (quarter or year).    In some Member States repeat applications may be very rare due to restrictions of the asylum procedure (e.g. time limits for lodging repeat application). Therefore the number of first time asylum applicants may equal or almost equal the number of asylum applicants.    The number of asylum applicants and the number of first instance decisions during the same reference period differs. This is due to the time lag between the date of asylum application and the date of the decision on asylum application. The duration of this time lag may vary considerably depending on the national asylum procedure and the administrative workload. Asylum application lodged in one reference period may therefore result in a decision in a later period, while some asylum decisions reported for that period may relate to the applications lodged in previous reference periods.     First time asylum applicant     for international protection (as defined by Articles 2(h) and 2(i) of     Qualification Directive 2011/95/EU    ) means a person having submitted an application for international protection for the     first time    in a given Member State. The term 'first time' implies no time limits and therefore a person can be recorded as first time applicant     only if he or she had never applied for international protection in the reporting country in the past    , irrespective of the fact that he or she is found to have applied in another Member State of the European Union.    Applications submitted by persons who are subsequently found to be a subject of a     Dublin    procedure are included in the statistics on first time asylum applicants if such persons are also a subject of a first asylum application. All Member States are requested to supply these data but their provision is voluntary. As persons are counted once only, statistics on first time asylum applicants may be used for preparation of annual aggregates.  ";0;0;"b'\x0bBN\x8d<4\xe6"" \x00'";
383;613;"  An     asylum    procedure where an     asylum applicant    lodges an     application for international protection    , can result in different decisions, positive or negative, at the different stages of the procedure.    Asylum decisions can be distinguished according to the     stage in the procedure    when they are taken:     First instance decision     means a decision granted by the respective authority acting as a first instance of the administrative/judicial asylum procedure in the receiving country.     Final decision     means a decision on whether the third-country national or stateless person be granted refugee or subsidiary protection status by virtue of      Directive 2011/95/EU     and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive, irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the Member States concerned pending its outcome. The asylum procedures and the numbers/levels of decision making bodies differ between Member States. The true 'final instance' may be, according to the national legislation and administrative procedures, a decision of the highest national court. However, it is not intended that these statistics should cover rare or exceptional cases determined by the highest courts. Thus, the statistics related to the 'final decisions' should refer to decisions against which there is no further possibility to appeal on the substance of the decision but only on procedural grounds.    For the purpose of the Asylum data collection the concepts of first instance decision and final decision include also data on decisions granting or rejecting 'Humanitarian status' under national law concerning international protection.    Depending on the     outcome    of the decisions, asylum applicants can be categorised in different groups:     Person being a subject of a pending application     means a person who is the subject of an application for international protection under consideration by the responsible national authority at the end of the reference period. It includes the number of persons with pending applications at all instances of the administrative and/or judicial procedure.     Person granted refugee status     means a person covered by a decision granting      refugee     status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Refugee status means status as defined in Art.2(e) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     within the meaning of Art.1 of the      Geneva Convention     relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the      New York Protocol     of 31 January 1967.     Person granted subsidiary protection status     means a person covered by a decision granting subsidiary protection status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Subsidiary protection status means status as defined in Art.2(g) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     . According to Art.2(f) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     a person eligible for subsidiary protection means a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as defined in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) does not apply, and is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.     Person granted authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons     means a person covered by a decision granting authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons under national law concerning international protection, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. It includes persons who are not eligible for international protection as currently defined in the first stage legal instruments, but are nonetheless protected against removal under the obligations that are imposed on all Member States by international refugee or human rights instruments or on the basis of principles flowing from such instruments. Examples of such categories include persons who are not removable on ill health grounds and unaccompanied minors.     Person granted temporary protection     means a person covered by a decision granting temporary protection as defined in Art.2(a) of      Council Directive 2001/55/EC     i.e. 'a procedure of exceptional character to provide, in the event of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such persons, in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process this influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation, in the interests of the persons concerned and other persons requesting protection'.     Rejected applicant     means a person covered by a decision rejecting an application for international protection, including decisions considering applications as inadmissible or as unfounded and decisions under priority and accelerated procedures, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period.    Eurostat further produces aggregates of the     Total number of decisions    and the     Total number of positive decisions    issued during a reference period, for each ""stage in the procedure"" (first or final). Thus,     Total number of positive decisions    refers to the sum of decisions granting refugee status, subsidiary protection status, authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons (for countries where applicable) and temporary protection status. Whereas     Total number of decisions    refers to     Total number of positive decisions    plus rejected applicants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d<\x13\xf3\xf6 \x00';
384;614;   (Asylum) recognition rate    is defined as the share of positive decisions in the total number of     asylum decisions    for each stage of the     asylum    procedure (i.e.     first instance    and     final on appeal    ). The total number of decisions consists of the sum of positive and negative decisions.    Calculation of the overall recognition rate for all stages of the asylum procedure cannot be made due to lacking information linking the outcomes at first instance and final on appeal for each person concerned. As some of the     applicants    rejected at the first instance and who lodged an appeal in the same year receive a final negative decision, it would lead to multiplication of some rejected applicants and would cause underestimation of the overall recognition rate. Final decisions on appeal statistics broken down by the year of the first instance rejection would be required to avoid this multiplication.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d<}:J \x00';
385;615;  Repeated asylum applicant means a person who made a further application for international protection, in a given Member State, after a final decision (positive/negative/discontinuation) has been taken on a previous application.    The concept includes:     Subsequent applicants     : as defined in Article 2 (q) of the      Asylum Procedures Directive     this means persons who made a further application for international protection after a final decision (positive/negative/discontinuation) has been taken on a previous application, including cases where the applicant has explicitly withdrawn his or her application and cases where the determining authority has rejected an application following its implicit withdrawal in accordance with Article 28(1). Only applications where Article 40 of the same Directive is applied are considered as subsequent.

Buildings do not necessarily need walls. It is sufficient for them to have a roof, but there must be a demarcation which constitutes the individual character of the building to be used separately.    A separate building is any free-standing building; also, in the case of interconnected structures (e.g. semi-detached or terraced houses), any unit separated from other units by a fire wall extending from roof to cellar is considered an individual building. If there is no fire wall the interconnected building units are regarded as individual buildings if they have their own access (own entrance) as well as their own utility system and are separately usable.    For technical reasons, buildings also include separately usable underground constructions which can be entered by persons and are suitable or intended for protecting persons, animals or objects (e.g. underground shelters, underground hospitals, underground shopping centers and workshops, underground garages).

400;639;"  The (industrial)     producer price index    , abbreviated as     PPI    and also called     output price index    , is a     business-cycle    indicator showing the development of transaction prices for the monthly industrial output of economic activities.    The PPI does not only serve as an early indicator of     inflationary    pressures in the economy before it reaches the consumer, but it can also record the evolution of prices over longer time periods.    The PPI for a specific     economic activity    measures the monthly change in the trading price of products and related services. The PPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the seller's perspective. The prices collected in period     t    should refer to orders booked during period     t    (at the moment of the order) and not the moment when the commodities leave the factory gates. Price indices are calculated as a     weighted    average of the relevant products.    PPIs are calculated for the total, the     domestic    and the     non-domestic    markets, with the latter further split between     euro area     and     non-euro area    markets. The indicators of domestic and non-domestic prices require separate producer price indices to be compiled according to the destination of the product. The residency of the third party which has ordered or bought the product defines the destination. The domestic market is defined as all third parties ordering or buying which are residents in the same national territory as the     observation unit    from which sales or orders are collected. When combined, the sub-indices for the domestic and the non-domestic markets give the total change in the PPI for a given product.    The appropriate price for calculating the PPI is the basic price that excludes     VAT    and similar deductible taxes which are directly linked to     turnover    , as well as all duties and taxes on the goods and services invoiced. However, subsidies on products received by the producer, if there are any, should be added to the basic price.    All price-determining characteristics should be taken into account, including the:    quantity of units sold;     transport provided;     rebates;     service conditions;     guarantee conditions;     destination.

401;642;  The     services producer price index    , abbreviated as     SPPI    , is a     business-cycle    indicator which measures the gross change in the trading price of services including e.g. freight and passenger transport, postal services, accomodation and food services, information and communciation services, computer programming, consultancy services, legal and accounting services, architecture and engineering, advertising, office support, security services etc. In general the     NACE    sections , H, I, J, L, M, and N are covered by SPPIs. The only exceptions in these areas are veterinary services (M75), services of head offices (M70.1), and scientific research services (M72).    Public services are excluded, as for those services (for example health and education) the notion of price is not obvious and the ways they are provided are very different from country to country. Moreover, STS does not cover banking and insurance activities and thus also no prices for such services.    The     Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2020/1197    of 30 July 2020 implementing     Regulation (EU) No 2019/2152    of 27 November 2019 (European Business Statistics Regulation) introduced SPPIs for a large number of services industries that were not covered by the former STS Regulation.    Similar to the industrial     producer price index    , the SPPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the perspective of the seller. The SPPIs are used as an aspect of output for the seller and as a cost factor for the buyer    The SPPI covers services provided for all uses, i.e. for     intermediate    as well as for final consumption. However, the economic service activities for which the SPPI is calculated (see above) are mainly consumed by other businesses for the production of their own goods and services.     Inflation    experienced by consumers is measured by the     harmonised index of consumer prices    .    The SPPI is an important measure of inflation as services account for over half of modern economies. It is also employed to analyze the origins of inflation since it shows which services consumed by other businesses might be the sources of price increases.The SPPI is used as well as a     deflator    for services turnover (measured in current prices) and thus allows calculating a volume indicator for services similar to the     volume index of industrial production    .

416;667;   Inflation    is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. When there is inflation in an economy, the value of money decreases because a given amount will buy fewer goods and services than before.    Inflation in an economy is often calculated by examining a basket of goods and services and comparing the changes in the prices of that basket over time.    The     inflation rate    is the percentage change in the price index for a given period compared to that recorded in a previous period. It is usually calculated on a year-on-year or annual basis.    For an index value of 183.1 for January of this year, and an index value of 178.4 recorded in January last year, the annual rate of inflation of January this year would be:    (183.1 / 178.4 ? 1) * 100 = 2.6 %    Similarly, one may compile month-on-month rates of change or average annual rates of change.    Deflation    is the opposite of inflation. It is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services and represents an increase in the value of money, where an amount of money can be exchanged for more goods and services.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x91J\xccR \x00';

This sales deflator is an index with a similar methodology to that of an     output price index    but it is adapted specifically for the retail trade. It reflects price changes in the goods sold rather than the sales service provided.    It should be noted that the volume of sales is different from the volume of retail trade services. The latter takes into account changes in the quality of the trade service supplied. As such, the sales volume is conceptually different from the     production index    which takes into account quality changes.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dU\xb5\xfe\xc2 \x00';
418;669;   City heating    , also known as     district heating    , is the distribution of heat through a network to one or several buildings using hot water or steam produced centrally, often from     co-generation    plants, from waste heat from industry, or from dedicated heating systems.    Large-scale district heating in Europe is commonly found in central and eastern Europe and in the Nordic countries.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d$\x9ap\xa0 \x00';
419;671;  A     divorce    is the final legal dissolution (ending) of a     marriage    . A divorce is the type of separation between spouses that confers on both parties the right to remarry under civil, religious or other provisions, according to the laws of each country. Divorce is possible in all     European Union    Member States. In almost all countries, divorces are registered at a court.    The     crude divorce rate    is the ratio of the number of divorces during the year to the average population in that year. The value is expressed per 1000 inhabitants.    A     divorce rate by duration of marriage    can be calculated for each calendar year     n    , by relating the number of divorces at the end of     x    years of marriage to the initial number of marriages in year     n-x    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d$\xa5\xe8\x97 \x00';
420;672;   Inflation    is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. When there is inflation in an economy, the value of money decreases because a given amount will buy fewer goods and services than before.    Inflation in an economy is often calculated by examining a basket of goods and services and comparing the changes in the prices of that basket over time.    The     inflation rate    is the percentage change in the price index for a given period compared to that recorded in a previous period. It is usually calculated on a year-on-year or annual basis.    For an index value of 183.1 for January of this year, and an index value of 178.4 recorded in January last year, the annual rate of inflation of January this year would be:    (183.1 / 178.4 ? 1) * 100 = 2.6 %    Similarly, one may compile month-on-month rates of change or average annual rates of change.    Deflation    is the opposite of inflation. It is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services and represents an increase in the value of money, where an amount of money can be exchanged for more goods and services.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d$\xb73\xaa \x00';
421;676;  A     deflator    is a figure expressing the change in prices over a period of time for a product or a basket of products, which is used to 'deflate' (price adjust) a measure of value changes for the same period (for example the sales of this product or basket), thus removing the price increases or decreases and leaving only volume changes.    A deflator compares a     reference period    to a base period, and it can be expressed either as an index or a percentage change. A value which has been adjusted by way of a deflator is called     deflated    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d$\xd7\x15) \x00';

A     waterway    is a river, canal, lake or other stretch of water, that is not part of the sea, which through natural or man-made features is suitable for navigation. This term includes both navigable rivers and lakes and navigable canals. The length of rivers and canals is measured in mid-channel. The length of lakes and lagoons is measured along the shortest navigable route between the two most distant points that perform transport operations. A waterway forming a common frontier between two countries is reported by both states. Waterways also include river estuaries, the boundary with the sea being that point nearest the sea where the width of the river is both less than 3 kilometres (km) at low water and less then 5 km at high water.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dT\xc6\xdc\x0e \x00';

499;787;   Crop rotation    on     arable land    is the practice of alternating crops grown on a specific field in a planned pattern or sequence in successive crop years so that crops of the same species are not grown without interruption on the same field. In a rotation the crops are normally changed annually, but they can also be multi-annual. If the same crop is grown continuously, the term     monoculture    can be used to describe the phenomenon.    Although there is no limit to the number of crops that are used in a rotation, nor in the amount of time that a rotation takes to complete, it is commonly accepted to use a threshold of 5 years to separate arable land from permanent crops or permanent grassland. This means that if a plot is used for the same crop for 5 years or more, without in the meantime removing the preceding crop and establishing a new one, then this plot is not considered to be in crop rotation and therefore is not to be taken as part of arable land.    Special cases    There are crops that do not fit this pattern, and that are treated differently. For example hops has been chosen to always be an arable crop, despite being perennial and often being renewed at intervals beyond 5 years, and berries are considered permanent crops despite being renewed sometimes annually.

It is an important measure of     inflation    in the     European Union (EU)    .    CPIs aim to cover the whole set of goods and services consumed within the territory of a country by the population. To do this, a representative set is selected; the so-called ?consumer basket?. Consumer goods and services include, for example, food and beverages, products for personal hygiene, newspapers and periodicals, expenditure on housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, health, transport, communications, education, restaurants and hotels.    Many of these goods and services are     bought frequently or consumed on a daily basis    .    CPIs may be used for a wide variety of purposes, including:    as a guide for monetary policy;     for the indexation of commercial contracts, wages, social protection benefits or financial instruments;     as a tool for      deflating     the      national accounts     or calculating changes in national consumption or living standards.

505;798;   Coverage    , is the extent to which the real, observed population matches the ideal or normative population. A population is the domain from which     observations    for a particular topic can be drawn.    Under-coverage    results from the omission of units belonging to the target population, while     over-coverage    occurs due to the inclusion of elements that do not belong to the target population. For instance, for     causes of death    statistics, all deaths of residents occurring in a given year should be covered. However, information about residents dying abroad might not be included in all countries (resulting in under-coverage), and deaths of non-residents might be included (resulting in over-coverage).    An understanding of coverage is required to facilitate the comparison of data. Coverage issues are often explained through the use of tables showing linkages (e.g. part or full correspondence) and can also be used to explain the ratio of coverage. The rules and conventions of coverage are largely determined by concept definitions, scope rules, information requirements and, in the case of statistical collections and classifications, collection and counting units and the collection methodology.  ;0;0;"b'\x0bBN\x8d*7""\x8e \x00'";

From a     tourism    standpoint any person who moves to another country and intends to stay there for more than one year is immediately considered to be a resident of that country, similar to its other residents.    On the other hand, citizens residing abroad who return to their country of citizenship on a temporary visit are included with     non-resident    visitors. Citizenship is indicated in the person's passport (or other identification document), while country of residence has to be determined by means of question or inferred, for instance from the person's address.

Product classifications are designed to categorize products that have common characteristics. They provide the basis for collecting and calculating statistics on the production,     distributive trade    , consumption, international trade and transport of such products.    CPA product categories are related to activities as defined by the     Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE)    . Each CPA product - whether a transportable or non-transportable good or a service - is assigned to one single NACE activity. This linkage to NACE activities gives the CPA a structure parallel to that of NACE at all levels.    The CPA is part of an integrated system of statistical classifications, developed mainly under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Division. This system makes it possible to compare statistics across countries and in different statistical domains.

526;831;"   Business services    are activities (     business functions    ) performed by an     enterprise    for another enterprise and/or the public administration. They include:     technical services     such as engineering, architecture and technical studies;     computer services     such as software design and database management;     other professional services     such as legal, accounting, consultancy and management services.    The business services sector refers to the economic activities covered by     NACE    Rev. 2 Divisions 62, 69, 71, 73 and 78 and Groups 58.2, 63.1 and 70.2, and the enterprises or parts of enterprises that carry out those activities.    Although business services are in principle supplied to other enterprises and/or the public administration,     households    may also make use of some of them, especially legal, architectural, engineering and technical testing activities. Many of these services could be performed in-house by the enterprise itself, but purchasing (outsourcing) them from service providers enables an enterprise to focus on core activities and take advantage of the specialization offered by service providers. As such, an efficient and successful business services sector can contribute to the overall competitiveness of the economy.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d4Z\x1d\xdb \x00';

528;834;   Conventional tillage    refers to the     arable land    treated by conventional tillage which involves inversion of the soil, normally with a mouldboard or a disc plough as the primary tillage operation, followed by secondary tillage with a disc harrow.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d,8@V \x00';
529;835;   Conservational tillage    refers to the     arable land    treated by conservation (low) tillage, which is a     tillage practice    or system of practices that leaves plant residues (at least 30 %) on the soil surface for erosion control and moisture conservation, normally by not inverting the soil.    Conservation tillage can include the following systems:     Strip tillage or zonal tillage     refers to a system where strips 5 to 20 cm in width are prepared to receive the seed whilst the soil along the intervening bands is not disturbed and remains covered with residues. The system causes more soil disturbance and provides less cover along the rows than zero tillage.     Tined tillage or vertical tillage     refers to a system where the arable land is prepared with equipment which does not invert the soil and which cause little compaction. For this reason, the surface normally remains with a good cover of residues on the surface.     Ridge tillage     is a system of ridges and furrows. The ridges may be narrow or wide and the furrows can be parallel to the contour lines or constructed with a slight slope, depending on whether the objective is to conserve moisture or to drain excess moisture. The ridges can be semi-permanent or be constructed each year which will govern the amount of residue material that remains on the surface.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d-Gg\xde \x00';
530;836;   Tillage practices    refer to the tillage operations carried out between the harvest and following sowing/cultivation operation. Tillage, crop rotation and     soil cover    are practices related to pesticide and nutrient runoff, soil erosion, soil compaction etc. The information about tillage practices helps assess other indicators as such on soil cover, risks of nitrate leaching, and organic matter of soils. Any disturbance of soils may enhance turnover of nutrients and thereby increase the potential risk of loss of, for example, nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus through surface runoff and soil erosion. Especially, tillage in the autumn may increase the potential risk of losses during the following winter period.    Data on tillage of arable land were collected in the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) 2010.    The different tillage practices distinguished are:     Conservation tillage      Conventional tillage      Zero tillage   ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\\\xc1\x86\xd5 \x00';
531;837;   Zero tillage    refers to the     arable land    on which no     tillage    is applied between harvest and sowing. Zero tillage is a minimum tillage practice in which the crop is sown directly into soil not tilled since the harvest of the previous crop. Weed control is achieved by the use of herbicides and/or appropriate mulching and stubble is retained for erosion control.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dR\xfe\xe6\xf5 \x00';
532;840;"   Classification of types of construction    , abbreviated as     CC    , is a nomenclature for the classification of     constructions    according to their type. It is based on the provisional     Central product classification (CPC)    published in 1991 by the     United Nations    , and accordingly subdivides constructions in the main categories of     buildings    and     civil engineering works    .    CC is designed to serve different purposes such as statistics on construction activities, construction reports, building and housing censuses and price statistics on construction work and     national accounts    . In addition, CC is to be used for the definition of constructions which will be needed for the provision of information on specific variables (e.g.     building permits    ,     production    ) concerning     short-term statistics    .    The CC elaborates the CCP to more detailed levels, using a decimal system:    1-digit: 2 Sections, 'Buildings' and 'Civil engineering works';     2-digit: 6 Divisions;     3-digit: 20 Groups;     4-digit: 46 Classes.    The classification principles of CC are based mainly on the technical design resulting from the special use of a structure (e.g. commercial buildings, road structures, waterworks, pipelines) and, particularly for buildings, on its main use (e.g.     residential    ,     non-residential    ). The site of a construction, its ownership and the institution to which it belongs are normally irrelevant criteria. Civil engineering works are classified mainly according to the engineering design which is determined by the purpose of the structure.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d0\x1e}\xa6 \x00';
533;842;   Consolidated accounts    are accounts drawn up to reflect the affairs of a group of entities. For example, a ministry or holding company with many different operating agencies or subsidiary companies may prepare consolidated accounts reflecting the affairs of the organisation as a whole, as well as accounts for each operating agency/subsidiary.    Accounts for each of the operating agencies, subsidiaries etc. making up a group are called     non-consolidated accounts    .    In national accounts, ESA 2010 specifies the differing analytical uses of consolidated and unconsolidated data. Within financial sector accounts, typically consolidated as well as unconsolidated data is reported. In non-financial accounts for general government (     GFS    ), the following transactions are consolidated within subsectors and within     general government    : property income, other current transfers and capital transfers.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d,u\x8c\xba \x00';

The financial account of a(n) (institutional) sector may be consolidated or non-consolidated.    The     non-consolidated financial account    of a sector shows the changes in financial assets and liabilities due to all financial transactions in which institutional units classified in this sector are involved.    The     consolidated financial account    of a sector shows the changes in financial     assets    and     liabilities    due to financial transactions between institutional units classified in the sector under consideration and other institutional units or the rest of the world.

535;844;"  The number (and index) of     building permits    or     construction permits    is a     leading indicator    in the     business cycle    which provides some information about the workload of the construction industry in the near future.    A building permit is the final authorisation to start work on a building project. It is granted by public authorities in response to an application by a principal and based on a specific building plan. There are differences in the rules and procedures according to which such permits are granted in the     European Union (EU)    Member States, but in none of the countries does the permit imply an obligation to start the construction; as a result, some permits might not be used by the builders. Therefore the index for building permits might overestimate future actual building projects.    There are two indices for building permits, representing different aspects:    the number of      dwellings     ;     the square metres of useful floor area (or alternative size measures).    The first index refers only to residential buildings (dwellings), the second also includes non-residential buildings, i.e. hotels, office buildings, industrial buildings etc.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d,\x94\x98& \x00';

Fixed assets decline in value due to normal wear and tear, foreseeable ageing (obsolescence) and a normal rate of accidental damage. Unforeseen obsolescence, major catastrophes and the depletion of natural resources, however, are not included.    Unlike ""depreciation"" in business accounting, CFC in national accounts is not a method for allocating the costs of past expenditures on fixed assets over subsequent accounting periods.

Direct costs (compensation of employees):      gross wages and salaries paid in cash;       direct remuneration (pay) and bonuses;       wages and salaries in kind (company products, housing, company cars, meal vouchers, crèches, etc.).      Direct costs are dominated by wages and salaries paid in cash.     Indirect costs:      employers?        actual social contributions       (i.e. statutory, collectively agreed, contractual and voluntary social security contributions);       employers?        imputed social contributions       (mostly guaranteed pay in the event of sickness or short-time working, plus severance pay and compensation instead of notice);       vocational training       costs;       recruitment costs and work clothes given by the employer;       taxes paid by the employer (based on their wages and salaries bill or on the numbers they employ)       minus subsidies received by the employer (intended to refund part or all of the cost of direct pay).      Indirect costs are dominated by employers? actual social contributions, in particular by employers? statutory social security contributions.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x8c2\x8dC \x00';
557;877;   Comparability ratio    in     cause-of-death    statistics is a measure, expressed as a ratio, indicating the net effect of a change in classification (e.g. from     ICD    -9 to ICD-10, or ICD-10 updates) or method (e.g. manual vs. automated coding) on a particular cause of death.

559;879;   Purchasing power parities    , abbreviated as     PPPs    , are indicators of price level differences across countries. PPPs tell us how many currency units a given quantity of goods and services costs in different countries. Using PPPs to convert expenditure expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency, the     purchasing power standard (PPS)    , eliminates the effect of price level differences across countries created by fluctuations in currency     exchange rates    .    Purchasing power parities are obtained by comparing price levels for a basket of comparable goods and services that are selected to be representative of consumption patterns in the various countries.    PPPs make it possible to produce meaningful indicators (based on either price or volume) required for cross-country comparisons, truly reflecting the differences in the purchasing power of, for example,     households    . Monetary exchange rates cannot be used to compare the volumes of income or expenditure because they usually reflect more elements than just price differences, for example, volumes of financial transactions between currencies and expectations in the foreign exchange markets.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dpM\x8a8 \x00';

The     Community innovation survey    , abbreviated as     CIS    , is conducted in every     European Union (EU)    Member State to collect data on     innovation    activities in enterprises, i.e. on     product innovation    (goods or services) and     process innovation    (organisational and marketing aspects).    The legal basis for CIS is     Regulation (EC) No 1450/2004    of 13 August 2004 carrying out Decision 1608/2003/EC on the production and development of Community statistics on innovation.    The survey covers areas such as new or significantly improved goods or services, and the introduction of new or significantly improved processes, logistics or distribution methods. It also gives information on the characteristics of innovation activity at the     enterprise    level, thereby creating a better understanding of the innovation process and the effects of innovation on the economy.    The CIS produces a broad set of indicators on innovation activities, innovation spending, effects of innovation, public funding, innovation co-operation, sources of information for innovation, main obstacles on innovation activity and methods of protecting intellectual property rights.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d.cu\xc1 \x00';
563;887;   Innovation    is the use of new ideas, products or methods where they have not been used before.    For the     Community Innovation Survey (CIS)    , an innovation is defined as a new or significantly improved product (good or service) introduced to the market, or the introduction within an     enterprise    of a new or significantly improved process.    Innovations are based on the results of new technological developments, new technology combinations, or the use of other knowledge, acquired by the enterprise. The innovations may be developed by the innovating enterprise or by another enterprise. However, purely selling innovations wholly produced and developed by other enterprises is not included as an innovation activity, nor is introducing products with purely aesthetic changes.    Innovations should be new to the enterprise concerned: for product innovations, they do not necessarily have to be new to the market and, for process innovations, the enterprise does not necessarily have to be the first one to have introduced the process.    Enterprises carrying out innovation activities cover all types of innovators including product and process innovators, as well as those enterprises with only ongoing and/or abandoned innovation activities. The proportion of enterprises undertaking innovation activities is also called the propensity (tendency) to innovate.    A     product innovation     is the market introduction of a new or a significantly improved good or service.    A     process innovation     is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production process, distribution method or support activity for goods or services.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x90\xcb\x06\xbc \x00';

Its objectives are:    increasing productivity;     stabilizing markets;     ensuring security of supply and reasonable prices to the consumer.    Although a common fisheries policy was already provided for in the     Treaty of Rome    in 1957, it did not become a common policy in the full sense of the term until 1983. The CFP has the same legal basis (Articles 32-38 of the     EC Treaty    ) as the     Common agricultural policy    and shares the same aims mentioned above. Like the CAP, the CFP is a shared responsibility of the European Union and its Member States.

In general terms, common land is     utilised agricultural area (UAA)    owned by a public authority (state, parish, etc.) over which another person is entitled to exercise rights of common, and these rights are generally exercisable in common with others.    Common land is found in Mediterranean Member States (Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal), in mountainous countries (Austria, Norway and Switzerland), in some East European countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia), in countries which have extensive grassland areas (Ireland, United Kingdom and Iceland) and in Germany.    Common land consists mainly of permanent grassland, although it could also consist of horticulture or arable land. A large percentage of these areas is used for grazing animals.    In common land units, the area used by each holding is not individualised but is counted as part of the     utilised agricultural area (UAA)    .

Farming on rented land (RENT_UAA) - utilised agricultural area rented by the agricultural holding in return for a fixed rent agreed in advance (in cash, kind or otherwise), and for which there is a (written or oral) tenancy agreement. The utilised agricultural area is allocated to only one agricultural holding. If the utilised agricultural area is rented out to more than one agricultural holding during the reference year, it is normally allocated to the agricultural holding with which it is associated on the survey reference day or which used it for the longest period during the reference year.     Farming on common land (CMNL_UAA) - utilised agricultural area used by the agricultural holding but not belonging directly to it, i.e. on which common rights apply.     Share farming or other tenure modes (SHROTH_UAA) - utilised agricultural area which is      shared, meaning farmed in partnership by the landlord and the share cropper under a written or oral share-farming contract.

Resource management comprises a large variety of activities, including the production of energy from renewable sources, measures to improve energy efficiency, recovery of materials, and sustainable management of water and forest resources.    For the purposes of CReMA the following definitions are used:    Resource management activities    are production activities using equipment, labour, manufacturing techniques, information networks or products, to create goods or services for managing natural resources.    Resource management products    are:    resource management services produced by resource management activities; and     adapted and more-resource efficient and connected products.    In analogy to environmental protection,     resource management expenditure    consists of outlays and other transactions related to:    inputs for resource management activities (energy, raw materials and other intermediate inputs, wages and salaries, taxes linked to production, consumption of fixed capital);     capital formation and the buying of land (investment) for resource management activities;     users? outlays for buying resource management products;     transfers for resource management (subsidies, investment grants, international aid, donations, taxes earmarked for resource management, etc.).

597;942;  A     marriage    is the act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship between two persons is formed. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognised by the laws of each country.    In all     European Union (EU)    and other European countries, contracting a     civil marriage    (before official authorities and on a legal basis) is possible. However, the relation between a civil marriage and a     religious marriage    (before religious representative only) is not the same in all countries. In 15 countries (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden as well as Norway and the United Kingdom) a religious marriage has consequences for the civil marriage in the sense that a religious marriage is recognised by the state as being equivalent to a civil marriage. France states that a religious marriage has no consequences for marital status, unless it has been contracted abroad.    The     crude marriage rate    is the ratio of the number of marriages during the year to the average population in that year.

The legal basis for CIS is     Regulation (EC) No 1450/2004    of 13 August 2004 carrying out Decision 1608/2003/EC on the production and development of Community statistics on innovation.    The survey covers areas such as new or significantly improved goods or services, and the introduction of new or significantly improved processes, logistics or distribution methods. It also gives information on the characteristics of innovation activity at the     enterprise    level, thereby creating a better understanding of the innovation process and the effects of innovation on the economy.    The CIS produces a broad set of indicators on innovation activities, innovation spending, effects of innovation, public funding, innovation co-operation, sources of information for innovation, main obstacles on innovation activity and methods of protecting intellectual property rights.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d16S\\ \x00';

Environmental protection activities    are production activities using equipment, labour, manufacturing techniques, information networks or products, to create an output of goods or services.    Environmental protection products    are:    the environmental protection services produced by environmental protection activities; and     adapted (cleaner) and connected products.     Expenditure for environmental protection    consists of outlays and other transactions related to:    inputs for environmental protection activities (energy, raw materials and other intermediate inputs, wages and salaries, taxes linked to production, consumption of fixed capital);     capital formation and the buying of land (investment) for environmental protection activities;     users? outlays for buying environmental protection products;     transfers for environmental protection (subsidies, investment grants, international aid, donations, taxes earmarked for environmental protection, etc.).

629;984;"   Classification of types of construction    , abbreviated as     CC    , is a nomenclature for the classification of     constructions    according to their type. It is based on the provisional     Central product classification (CPC)    published in 1991 by the     United Nations    , and accordingly subdivides constructions in the main categories of     buildings    and     civil engineering works    .    CC is designed to serve different purposes such as statistics on construction activities, construction reports, building and housing censuses and price statistics on construction work and     national accounts    . In addition, CC is to be used for the definition of constructions which will be needed for the provision of information on specific variables (e.g.     building permits    ,     production    ) concerning     short-term statistics    .    The CC elaborates the CCP to more detailed levels, using a decimal system:    1-digit: 2 Sections, 'Buildings' and 'Civil engineering works';     2-digit: 6 Divisions;     3-digit: 20 Groups;     4-digit: 46 Classes.    The classification principles of CC are based mainly on the technical design resulting from the special use of a structure (e.g. commercial buildings, road structures, waterworks, pipelines) and, particularly for buildings, on its main use (e.g.     residential    ,     non-residential    ). The site of a construction, its ownership and the institution to which it belongs are normally irrelevant criteria.

The political authority of a country?s central government extends over the entire territory of the country. The central government can impose taxes on all resident institutional units and on non-resident units engaged in economic activities within the country. Central government typically is responsible for providing collective services for the benefit of the community as a whole, such as national defence, relations with other countries, public order and safety, and for regulating the social and economic system of the country. In addition, it may incurexpenditure on the provision of services, such as education or health, primarily for the benefit of individual households, and it may make transfers to other institutional units, including other levels of government.'  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d2\xf2\xa8< \x00';

Local governments typically provide a wide range of services to local residents, some of which may be financed out of grants from higher levels of government. Statistics for local government cover a wide variety of governmental units, such as counties, municipalities, cities, towns, townships, boroughs, school districts, and water or sanitation districts. Often local government units with different functional responsibilities have authority over the same geographic areas. For example, separate government units representing a town, a county, and a school district have authority over the same area. In addition, two or more contiguous local governments may organise a government unit with regional authority that is accountable to local governments.

634;998;"  In     national accounts (including government finance statistics and EDP)    , the social security funds subsector forms part of general government.    According to     ESA 2010    , paragraph 20.67, it is defined as:     The social security funds subsector (S.1314) consists of all social security units, regardless of the level of government that operates or manages the schemes. If a social security scheme does not meet the requirements to be an institutional unit, it would be classified with its parent unit in one of the other subsectors of the general government sector. If public hospitals provide a non-market service to the community as a whole and if they are controlled by social security schemes, they are classified to the social security funds subsector.    Not all reporting countries have entities meeting the definition of social security funds. This is not the case for Ireland, Malta, the United Kingdom and Norway. For these countries, the entities involved in social security schemes are subsumed in other subsectors of general government.

635;999;  In some EU and EFTA countries, in the national accounts context, a state government subsector is defined. This is the case in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland. When applicable, state government is one of the four possible subsectors of general government.    In a colloquial context,     state government    could be described as the separate institutional units that exercise some government functions below those units at     central government    level and above those units at     local government    level, excluding the administration of     social security funds    .    In     ESA 2010    ,     state government    is defined in paragraph 20.63 and 20.64.    ESA 2010 20.63:     The state government (excluding social security) subsector (S.1312) consists of all government units in a federal system of government having a state or regional sphere of competence, with the possible exception of social security units. A state is the largest geographical area into which the country as a whole is divided for political or administrative purposes. Such areas are known by terms such as provinces, Länder, cantons, republics, or administrative regions. They all enjoy the sufficient level of power required in a federal system of government. The legislative, judicial, and executive authority of a state government extends over the entire area of an individual state, which usually includes numerous localities, but does not extend over other states. In many countries, state governments do not exist. In federal countries, considerable powers and responsibilities may be assigned to state governments, and compiling a state government subsector is appropriate in such cases.    ESA 20.64:     A state government usually has the fiscal authority to levy taxes on institutional units that are resident in, or engage in economic activities in, its area of competence. To be recognised as a government unit, the entity must be able to own assets, raise funds, and incur liabilities on its own account, and it must also be entitled to spend or allocate at least some of the taxes or other income that it receives according to its own policies. The entity may, however, receive transfers from the central government that are tied to certain specified purposes. A state government is able to appoint officers independently of external administrative control. If a government entity operating in a state is entirely dependent on funds from central government, and if central government also dictates the ways in which those funds are to be spent, then the entity is an agency of central government.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8db\xa8\x0c\xf3 \x00';

640;1006;"  A     census    is a survey conducted on the full set of observation objects belonging to a given population or universe.    Population and housing census    A population and housing census provides an opportunity to obtain a comprehensive and accurate picture of the population and the housing stock. It is a considerable undertaking, which provides a unique source of data that is invaluable for policy formation, as comparable data are collected for small areas (municipalities) that may be aggregated up through regions, to national and international aggregates. It may also be used to collect information on the main characteristics of individuals, families, households and the dwellings in which they live, in other words a range of geographic, demographic, social and economic information.    The results of a population and housing census are unique insofar as they provide detailed information down to the level of individual municipalities, while also providing a means to produce cross-tabulations of different variables. The essential features that distinguish a population and housing census from other data collections are:    individual enumeration ? in other words, the characteristics of each individual person and dwelling are separately recorded, allowing the cross-classification of various characteristics;     simultaneity ? the information obtained on individuals and dwellings refers to a specific and unique reference period;     universality ? the census provides data that covers all persons, households and dwellings in precisely defined territorial areas;     small-area data ? the census allows data to be produced for the smallest geographic areas of a country and for small subpopulations, subject to the protection of confidentiality.    Given its scope and magnitude, a population and housing census is generally conducted once every 10 years in Europe, although a few of the EU Member States have decided to conduct an annual census and others have censuses every five years. The latest census for all of the Member States and EFTA countries was conducted in 2011 and it entailed comprehensive administrative preparations by a wide range of public agencies including local, regional and national authorities, as well as national and international statistical agencies.    For the 2011 exercise, European legislation defined (for the first time) a detailed set of harmonised data to be collected in each EU Member State, based on international guidelines and recommendations prepared by the United Nations, Eurostat and the individual offices of each national statistical authority. As such, census data reflect extensive planning and close cooperation and consultation between Eurostat and the national statistical authorities, designed to facilitate the widest possible use of the population and housing census as a key resource for European social statistics. Each EU Member State was free to develop data collection and processing methods that they considered to be best suited to their own administrative practices and traditions.

642;1009;"   Calendar adjustment    is a statistical method for removing the     calendar effect    from an economic     time series    . The     calendar effect    is the variation caused by the changing number of particular week days or holidays in different months or other time periods (quarters, years).    Calendar adjustment is mainly used in the calculation of short-term statistics (STS), for converting gross (unadjusted/raw) figures or indices into their calendar adjusted equivalent. In order to adjust a figure or an index, the calendar nature of a given month is taken into account and calendar effects are removed, whatever their nature. The calendar effect may for example depend on:    the timing of certain public holidays (Easter can fall in March or in April, depending on the year);     the possible overlap of certain public holidays and non-working days (1 May can fall on a Sunday);     the occurrence of a leap year.     Working-day adjustment    is a part of the calendar adjustment which focusses on the changing number of working days (Monday - Friday) in the various months and their effect on statistical indicators (e.g. industrial production, production in construction) for these months.    It should be noted that the calendar adjustment can have effects on the yearly average of the index value in the reference year. Generally, the yearly average of the quarterly or monthly index values for the reference year is set to 100 for the unadjusted data (see article     Short-term business statistics - compiling indices at European level    ). This average might be changed by the calendar adjustment. Consider a year in which several holidays fall on a weekend. In this year the number of working days is higher than in other years. The average calendar adjusted index values will therefore be a bit lower than 100 in the reference year since the production (or turnover) was generated with a higher input of working days.    The effect of the calendar adjustment on the yearly average of the index values in the reference year is generally quite small. It depends on the calendar constellation in the reference year and the effect one additional working day has. As a rule the variation between the yearly average of the adjusted and the unadjusted index should not be more than +/- 2 percentage points.    Since seasonal adjustment also includes the calendar adjustment (as in the case of Eurostat STS data, where the calculation of the seasonally adjusted data is based on calendar adjusted data) the calendar adjustment effect on the yearly index average is also visible in the seasonally adjusted data.    It is possible to eliminate the effect after the calendar adjustment by re-referencing the results from the calendar adjustment again to an average of 100 in the reference year and some Member States of the EU do this while others prefer to show the effect in their data as an additional information to users.    The decision of re-referencing or showing the additional information has only an impact on the level of the time series, but has no effect on the growth rates.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d4\r\xd1\x12 \x00';
643;1010;   Seasonal adjustment    (or the adjustment of seasonal changes) is a statistical method for removing the effects of recurring seasonal influences which have been observed in the past from an economic     time series    , thus showing non-seasonal trends more clearly.    The level and direction of the seasonal effects depend on several factors such as the economic activity (e.g. the turnover of hotels typically increases during holidays, while the industrial production index develops more weakly during the summer). Seasonal effects vary between economies and countries (e.g. depending on which industries are particularly important in the economic structure) and between indicators.    Seasonal effects are one of the four main components that determine the development of economic indicators (apart from the general trend, cyclical effects and irregular components) and seasonal adjustment are a central element of time series analysis.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8di\xabp\x81 \x00';

648;1018;"   Calendar adjustment    is a statistical method for removing the     calendar effect    from an economic     time series    . The     calendar effect    is the variation caused by the changing number of particular week days or holidays in different months or other time periods (quarters, years).    Calendar adjustment is mainly used in the calculation of short-term statistics (STS), for converting gross (unadjusted/raw) figures or indices into their calendar adjusted equivalent. In order to adjust a figure or an index, the calendar nature of a given month is taken into account and calendar effects are removed, whatever their nature. The calendar effect may for example depend on:    the timing of certain public holidays (Easter can fall in March or in April, depending on the year);     the possible overlap of certain public holidays and non-working days (1 May can fall on a Sunday);     the occurrence of a leap year.     Working-day adjustment    is a part of the calendar adjustment which focusses on the changing number of working days (Monday - Friday) in the various months and their effect on statistical indicators (e.g. industrial production, production in construction) for these months.    It should be noted that the calendar adjustment can have effects on the yearly average of the index value in the reference year. Generally, the yearly average of the quarterly or monthly index values for the reference year is set to 100 for the unadjusted data (see article     Short-term business statistics - compiling indices at European level    ). This average might be changed by the calendar adjustment. Consider a year in which several holidays fall on a weekend. In this year the number of working days is higher than in other years. The average calendar adjusted index values will therefore be a bit lower than 100 in the reference year since the production (or turnover) was generated with a higher input of working days.    The effect of the calendar adjustment on the yearly average of the index values in the reference year is generally quite small. It depends on the calendar constellation in the reference year and the effect one additional working day has. As a rule the variation between the yearly average of the adjusted and the unadjusted index should not be more than +/- 2 percentage points.    Since seasonal adjustment also includes the calendar adjustment (as in the case of Eurostat STS data, where the calculation of the seasonally adjusted data is based on calendar adjusted data) the calendar adjustment effect on the yearly index average is also visible in the seasonally adjusted data.    It is possible to eliminate the effect after the calendar adjustment by re-referencing the results from the calendar adjustment again to an average of 100 in the reference year and some Member States of the EU do this while others prefer to show the effect in their data as an additional information to users.    The decision of re-referencing or showing the additional information has only an impact on the level of the time series, but has no effect on the growth rates.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dT\x0eap \x00';

The KAU groups together all the offices, production facilities etc. of an     enterprise    , which contribute to the performance of a specific economic activity defined at class level (four digits) of the European classification of economic activities (     NACE Rev. 2    .) For example, a kind-of-activity unit might be the combination of all parts of a metal producing enterprise that produce copper (class 24.44 in NACE Rev. 2); within the same enterprise there might be another KAU consisting of those parts that produce aluminium (class 24.42 in NACE Rev. 2). In order to statistically subdivide enterprises into KAUs the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus, employment and gross fixed capital formation.    The purpose of the KAU is to improve the homogeneity of statistical surveys by economic activity. In the above example, without the use of KAUs, it would be necessary to classify the enterprise either as a copper manufacturer or as an aluminium manufacturer. In such a way rather diverse enterprises might be considered to engage in the same economic activity which would make statistical results less clear and comparable.

Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion, when calculations are based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day zero and not day one; days 0-6 therefore correspond to ?completed week zero?; days 7-13 to ?completed week one?; and the 40th week of actual gestation is synonymous with ?completed week 39?.

The World Bank currently focuses on the achievement of the 'Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)'.    The World Bank comprises two institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). Its parent organization, the World Bank Group, incorporates three more: the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has 189 member countries, while the International Development Association (IDA) has 173 members (as of February 2019).    The IBRD is a market-based non-profit organization, lending primarily to 'middle-income' countries at interest rates only slightly higher than it has to pay for its own borrowings from capital markets; its high credit rating makes up for the relatively low interest rate on its loans. The IDA, on the other hand, is funded primarily by periodic grants voted to the institution by its more affluent member countries; it provides low or no-interest loans and grants to low-income countries with little or no access to international credit markets.

693;1092;   Fossil fuel    is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, coal products, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from plants and animals that existed in the geological past (for example, millions of years ago). Fossil fuels can be also made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels (for example in the oil refinery, crude oil is transformed into motor gasoline).    For decades fossil fuels satisfy most of the human energy requirements.Fossil fuels are carbon-based and their combustion results in the release of carbon into the Earth's atmosphere (carbon that was stored hundreds of millions years ago). It is estimated that roughly 80% of all manmade CO     2    and green-house gas emissions originate from fossil fuels combustion.

701;1103;   Healthy life years    , abbreviated as     HLY    and also called     disability-free life expectancy    (     DFLE    ), is defined as the number of years that a person is expected to continue to live in a healthy condition.    This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women, at birth and at ages 50 and 65. It is based on age-specific prevalence (proportions) of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition and age-specific     mortality    information. A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in functioning and without disability.    The indicator is calculated following the widely used     Sullivan method    . It is based on measures of the age-specific proportion of population with and without disability and on mortality data. Its interest lies in its simplicity, the availability of its basic data, and its independence of the size and age structure of the population.

717;1126;  The     Balance of trade    (BOT) is the difference between a country's imports and its exports for a given time period.    There are countries where it is almost certain that a trade deficit will occur. For example, the United States has had a trade deficit since 1976, in large part due to its imports of oil and consumer products. Conversely, China, a country that produces and exports many of the world's consumable goods, has recorded a trade surplus since 1995.    A trade surplus or deficit, taken on its own, is not necessarily a viable indicator of an economy's health. The numbers must be taken in context relative to the business cycle and other economic indicators. For example, in a recession, countries like to export more, creating jobs and demand in the economy. In a strong expansion, countries prefer to import more, providing price competition, which limits inflation.    In 2015, the European Union, Germany, China and Japan all had very large trade surpluses, while the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Australia and Canada had the largest trade deficits.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d9\x84\x1f\xb5 \x00';

It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources':    primary incomes already recorded in the      generation of income account     that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly      operating surplus     and mixed income,      compensation     of employees)     property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial      asset     or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit (      interest     ,      dividends     , withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of      foreign direct investment     , rents on land).

724;1134;   Annual work unit    (AWU) is the full-time equivalent employment, i.e. the total hours worked divided by the average annual hours worked in full-time jobs in the country. One annual work unit corresponds to the work performed by one person who is occupied on an agricultural holding on a full-time basis.    The minimum working hours for work to be considered full-time are defined in the national provisions governing contracts of employment. If these do not indicate the number of annual hours, then 1800 hours is to be taken as the minimum figure (225 working days of eight hours each).    As the volume of agricultural labour is being calculated on the basis of full-time equivalent jobs, no person can therefore represent more than one AWU. This constraint holds even if it is known that someone is working on agricultural activities for more than the number ofhours defining full-time in the Member State concerned.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d9\xde\xffZ \x00';

An illustration of 'weight' and 'weighting' is the calculation of the     harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP)    performed by     Eurostat    . The HICP is composed of prices for a 'basket' of items regularly purchased by consumers. However, some items such as food and newspapers are purchased more frequently than others, such as car insurance or a television set. To account for this, the various items in the basket are assigned a weight to reflect the total consumer expenditure on these items even though they may be low-cost individual purchases.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dTf\xf3\x0c \x00';

A weighted average or mean is one where each item being averaged is multiplied by a number (     weight    ) based on the item's relative importance, rather than treating each item equally. The weights or weightings are the equivalent of having that many similar items with the same value involved in the average. The result is summed and the total is divided by the sum of the weights.

These payments cover statutory, conventional, contractual and voluntary contributions in respect of insurance against social risks or needs;     employers?      imputed social contributions     represent the counterpart to unfunded social benefits paid directly by employers to their employees or former employees and other eligible persons without involving an insurance enterprise or autonomous pension fund, and without creating a special fund or segregated reserve for the purpose.    Both these types paid by the employer are considered in the national accounts to be part of the compensation of employees.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dAc\x8b  \x00';

808;1268;  The     activation policies    are policies designed to encourage unemployed to step up their job search after an initial spell of unemployment, by making receipt of benefit conditional on participation in programmes.    Labour market policy (LMP) measures refer to public labour market interventions where the main activity of participants is other than job-search related and where participation usually results in a change in labour market status. LMP measures cover primarily interventions that provide temporary support for groups that are disadvantaged in the labour market (unemployed, employed at risk, and inactive persons). LMP measures are classified by type of action and cover the following categories: training, job rotation and job sharing, employment incentives, supported employment and rehabilitation, direct job creation, and start-up incentives. Data on participants in LMP measures are defined as the stock of participants in regular activation measures (LMP categories 2-7) divided by the number of persons wanting to work.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dA}\xcf. \x00';

Public interventions refer to measures taken by general government in this respect which involve expenditure, either in the form of actual disbursements or of forgone revenue (reductions in taxes,     social contributions    or other charges normally payable). The scope of the database is also limited to labour market measures which are explicitly targeted in some way at groups of people with difficulties in the labour market ? referred to here as target groups. In broad terms, this covers people who are     unemployed    , people in employment but at risk of involuntary job loss, and     inactive persons    who are currently not part of the labour force (in the sense that they are not employed or unemployed according to the     ILO    definitions) but who would like to enter the labour market and are disadvantaged in some way.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x8b@.\xcf \x00';

Labour markets provide the structure through which workers and employers interact about jobs, working conditions and pay. Other actors are the institutions and processes of collective bargaining, including the roles played by employers? organisations and trade unions.

815;1281;"  An     accident at work    in the framework of the administrative data collection on European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) is a discrete occurrence during the course of work which leads to physical or mental harm. The phrase ?in the course of work? means whilst engaged in an occupational activity or during the time spent at work. This includes cases of road traffic accidents in the course of work but excludes accidents during the journey between home and the workplace.    The definition of accident at work in the module 'Accidents at work and other work-related health problems' of the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) is in principle the same as in ESAW with the exception that accidents with mental harm are excluded because they are difficult to distinguish from relevant 'work-related health problems'.    The following types of accidents are covered or not, respectively, by the above definition.    Cases included:      Cases of acute poisoning;       Wilful acts of other persons;       Accidents that occurred        on the premises of an employer other than that which employs the victim       ; this might include accidents during attendance at meetings or in the course of providing services on the premises of another employer visited for that purpose, during the course of the victim?s work;       Accidents that occur during meetings or other visits to locations outside the premises of the employer in which the employee is normally based; accidents during regular breaks, including lunch, in places organised by the employer; accidents during the delivery of goods to customers? premises (company, public administration or private individual) or while carrying out other services such as repairs, maintenance, errands, etc. on clients? premises; more permanent secondments to another employer, or during activities at home which are in the course of work; accidents caused by other work activities not related to the victim?s work activities, etc;       accidents in public places or public means of transport during a journey in the course of work;       Road traffic accidents in the course of work (public roads, car parks or private roads within the premises of the enterprise). Road accidents may involve persons whose occupational activity is exerted mainly on public roads, e.g., lorry or coach drivers, as well as occupational activities which frequently or occasionally imply journeys on public roads. Such occupational activities include, e.g., repairs, commercial activities or other service activities carried out on the premises of a customer. This category includes car accidents involving employees who occasionally drive from their office to an external meeting in the course of their work, or to places where the employer organised activities during regular breaks, including lunch;       Accidents on board any means of transport used in the course of work (underground railway, tram, train, boat, aircraft, etc.);       Other accidents (slips, falls, assaults, etc.) in a public place (pavement, staircases, etc.) or in the arrival and departure areas (station, port, airport, etc.) for any mean of transport during a journey in the course of work.      Cases excluded:      Commuting accidents: accidents that occur during the normal journey to or from home and place of work, i.e. road accidents that occur during the journey between the worker?s principal or secondary residence and the workplace, or while picking up children from school; accidents between home and a location attended for work-related training or between the workplace and a restaurant at which an employee habitually has lunch are excluded unless the restaurant is on company (5) premises;       Deliberate self-inflicted injuries;       Accidents from strictly natural causes: accidents caused solely by a medical condition, e.g. cardiac or cerebral incidents, or any other sudden-onset medical condition that occurred during work, without any obvious link to the occupational activity of the victim; nevertheless, such cases should be excluded only if other work-related causal elements are ruled out. For example, if a bricklayer felt faint (medical cause) and fell from scaffolding (work-related causal element), the accidental injury must be included in the ESAW methodology. Though the fall might not have occurred had he not felt faint, the injury he incurred was aggravated by the fact that he fell from scaffolding high above ground level in the course of his normal work;       Accidents, purely private: accidents in which the victims are not at their workplace, carrying out activities which are not work-related, for example, visiting a shop, a town hall, bank, station, hospital, post office, port, airport, etc.;       Accidents to members of the public, even if such an accident is due to a work activity within a company; this includes the family members of an employee or employer if they are on the premises of the company and become victims of an accident, i.e. children in, for example, the nursery in the company; Such accidents should not be counted as accidents at work although responsible employers would ensure that such incidents would normally be factored into insurance cover.

817;1286;  A     non-fatal      accident at work     is an accident which a victim survives and may result in one or more days of absence from work. A serious non-fatal accident at work is an accident at work resulting in more than three days' of absence from work. The Labour Force Survey modules on accidents at work and other work-related health problems report data on all non-fatal accidents (including the possibility to exclude those accidents with less than four days of absence). The administrative data collection on 'European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW)' reports only data on accidents with four days or more of absence as well as fatal accidents at work.    Only full calendar days of absence from work have to be considered, excluding the day of the accident. Consequently, ?more than three calendar days? means ?at least four calendar days?, which implies that only if the victim resumes work on the fifth (or subsequent) working day after the date on which the accident occurred should the incident be included.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d}+\x7fJ \x00';

It is carried out by each Member State and is used to compile weightings for important macroeconomic indicators, such as     consumer price indices    (used as measures of     inflation    ) and     national accounts    .    The data from the survey are broken down by household characteristics, such as income, socio-economic characteristics, size and composition,     degree of urbanisation    , and region.    Data collection involves a combination of one or more interviews and diaries or logs maintained by households and/or individuals, generally on a daily basis.    The basic unit of data collection and analysis in the surveys is the household. It is important to identify the reference person (often the head of the household) whose personal characteristics can be used in the classification and analysis of information on the household. The socio-economic group, occupation and employment status, income, sex and age of the reference person is often used to classify and present results.    Expenditure made by households to acquire goods and services is recorded at the price actually paid, which includes indirect taxes (     VAT    and excise duties) borne by the purchaser.    Two-thirds of the Member States carry out annual surveys, while the remainder have five-year or even longer intervals between surveys.

Through the ENP, the EU offers its neighbours a privileged relationship, building upon a mutual commitment to common values (democracy and human rights, rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and     sustainable development    ). The ENP goes beyond existing relationships to offer a deeper political relationship and economic integration. The central element of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the bilateral ENP Action Plans agreed between the EU and each partner. These plans set out an agenda of political and economic reforms with short and medium-term priorities.    With the Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Relationship Summit in May 2009, the EU and its eastern partners committed to a deeper bilateral engagement, the main goal of which will be to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the EU and interested partner countries through ?New Association Agreements?.

859;1343;   See      ESS disambiguation page     for other meanings of ESS.    A     European sample scheme    , abbreviated as     ESS    , is a method to combine data that have been compiled on country level to obtain an     European Union (EU)    or     euro area     aggregate    . The crucial issue of the ESS is that EU or euro area aggregates resulting from the ESS are statistically reliable while country results that form the input of an ESS may not necessarily be statistically reliable for all levels of detail at country level.    European sample schemes help to improve timeliness of statistical results and they also can reduce the burden on data providers and on national statistical authorities.    The rules for the European sample scheme are laid down in Annex III (Simplifications) of     Commission Regulation (EU) No 2020/1197    of 30 July 2020 implementing     Regulation (EU) No 2019/2152    of 27 November 2019 (European Business Statistics Regulation).

860;1344;   European size unit    , abbreviated as     ESU    , is a     standard gross margin    of EUR 1 200 that is used to express the economic size of an     agricultural holding    or farm.    For each activity (or 'enterprise') on a farm (for example wheat production,     dairy cows    or the output from a vineyard), the standard gross margin (SGM) is estimated based on the area used for the particular activity (or the number of heads of livestock) and a regional coefficient. The sum of all such margins derived from activities on a particular farm is its     economic size    , which is then expressed in European size units (by dividing the total SGM in euro by 1200, thus converting it to ESU).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dD\xfaY! \x00';

Together, they enable researchers, research institutions and businesses to increasingly circulate, compete and co-operate across borders. The aim is to give them access to a Europe-wide open space for knowledge and technologies in which transnational synergies and complementarities are fully exploited.    The creation of a European research area was given new impetus in 2007 with the     European Commission    's Green Paper on ERA.

This process has been observed in many regions of the     European Union (EU)    and at different periods, particularly on marginal land. Farmland abandonment has significant environmental consequences and is often associated with social and economic problems in rural areas. For parcels that were previously     intensively managed    , abandonment has brought environmental benefits, particularly a reduction in agricultural chemicals pollution.

Due to a decrease in inputs per land area the pressure on the environment may be decreased. A decrease in pesticides used, for instance, decreases the risk of pesticide run-off in     surface    and     groundwaters    .

871;1361;   Foreign direct investment    , abbreviated as     FDI    , is an international investment within the balance of payment accounts. Essentially, a resident entity in one economy seeks to obtain a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. A lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise, and an investor's significant influence on the management of the enterprise.    A direct investment enterprise is one in which a direct investor owns 10 % or more of the ordinary shares or votingrights (for an incorporated enterprise) or the equivalent (for an unincorporated enterprise).    FDI flows and positions: through direct investment flows, an investor builds up a FDI position that has an impact on an economy's international investment position. This FDI position (or FDI stock) differs from the accumulated flows because of revaluation (changes in prices or exchange rates), and other adjustments like rescheduling or cancellation of loans or debt-equity swaps.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dE\x8c+$ \x00';
872;1363;   Foreign affiliates statistics    , abbreviated as     FATS    , describe the activities of     foreign affiliates    : enterprises resident in a country or area, such as the     European Union (EU)    , controlled or owned by (multinational) enterprises which are resident outside that country or area.    Ultimate controlling institutional unit (UCI) of a foreign affiliate    shall mean the institutional unit, moving up a foreign affiliate's chain of control, which is not controlled by another institutional unit. The UCI has a key role in the statistics on globalisation. It determines how a unit should be treated in inward or outward FATS or FDI statistics.    A distinction can be made between     outward FATS    , on the activities of own affiliates abroad and     inward FATS    , on the activities of foreign enterprises within the own country or area.    Inward FATS    describe the overall activity of foreign affiliates resident in the compiling economy. A foreign affiliate within the terms of inward FATS is an enterprise resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit not resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, inward FATS describe how many jobs, how much turnover, etc. are generated by foreign investors in a given EU host economy. While FDI statistics give an idea of the total amount of capital invested by foreigners in the EU economy, FATS add to that information by providing insight into the economic impact those investments have in the EU in terms of job creation, etc.    Control ? in this context ? is the ability to determine the general policy of an enterprise by choosing appropriate directors, if necessary. However, control is often difficult to determine and, in practice, the share of ownership is often used as a proxy for control. FATS thus focus on the affiliates that are majority-owned by a single investor or by a group of associated investors acting in concert and owning more than 50% of ordinary shares or voting power. However, other criteria may also be relevant for defining foreign control, and thus other cases (multiple minority ownership, joint ventures, and qualitative assessment determining control) should be covered as regards assessment of control.    Outward FATS    describe the activity of foreign affiliates abroad controlled by the compiling country. Foreign affiliate within the terms of outward FATS is an enterprise not resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, outward FATS data describe, for example, how many employees work for affiliates of EU enterprises based abroad? In this case outward FATS give an idea of the economic impact of EU investments abroad (e.g. how many employees work for affiliates of German enterprises in China, etc.).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dE\x97\xe3B \x00';
873;1366;   Earnings    are the wage or salary paid to an     employee    . There are two main types:     Gross earnings     are paid in cash directly to an employee before any deductions for income tax and social security contributions paid by the employee. All bonuses, whether or not regularly paid, are included (13th or 14th month, holiday bonuses, profit-sharing, allowances for leave not taken, occasional commissions, etc.).     Net earnings     represent the part of remuneration that employees can actually spend and are calculated by deducting social security contributions and income taxes payable by employees from gross earnings and by adding family allowances if there are children in the family.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dE\xae\xbe\xa9 \x00';

Gross inland consumption does not include energy (fuel oil) provided to     international maritime bunkers    . It is calculated as follows:     primary production +        recovered products       + net imports + variations of stocks ? bunkers.     The difference between gross inland energy consumption and     gross (energy) consumption    is that in gross energy consumption the transformation output (electricity or heat produced from other energy sources) is included.

880;1374;"   The GFS presentation    In order to achieve consistency between on the one hand the     national accounts    logic (expressed in the sequence of accounts for production, generation, distribution, redistribution and use of income, accumulation and financing) and on the other hand a government budget perspective (government spending and receipts), two additional concepts about national accounts categories are defined in the     European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 2010)    - government     total revenue    and government     total expenditure    .    This alternative presentation to the national accounts     sequence of accounts    , at the core of which is the harmonised definition of total revenue and total expenditure is in many ways better suited to the particular analytical requirements of fiscal analysts. This presentation is commonly called the government finance statistics presentation (     GFS    ). Both presentations are complementary, with two tables in the GFS part of the national accounts transmission programme allowing for a full or near full presentation of both concepts. The key balancing item of the GFS non-financial accounts is net lending (+)/ net borrowing (-) or more commonly the surplus/ deficit. It is alternatively derived through the sequence of accounts or through the difference between total revenue and total expenditure.    Net lending (+)/ net borrowing (-)    =     Government surplus / deficit (net lending/ borrowing under EDP)    = gross saving (defined as gross disposable income less final consumption expenditure) less net capital transfers less gross acquisitions less disposals of non-financial     assets    , or =     total revenue less total expenditure    = (conceptually) net acquisition of financial assets less net incurrence of liabilities    Total revenue    Total revenue is the aggregate of all transactions recorded under resources in the ESA framework, including subsidies receivable in the current accounts and capital transfers receivable recorded in the capital account. Total expenditure is an aggregate of all transactions recorded under positive uses, and subsidies payable, in the current accounts as well as transactions (gross capital formation, acquisition less disposals of non-financial non-produced assets plus capital transfers payable) in the capital account.    A     revenue    transaction is one that increases net worth. Revenue is presented in the tables as the sum of taxes, net social contributions, sales (defined as market output, output for own final use and payments for non-market production), other current revenues and capital transfer revenues. Total taxes are composed of taxes on production and imports (so-called indirect taxes), current taxes on income and wealth (direct taxes), and capital taxes (some classifications of taxes include capital taxes as a component of direct taxes). Net social contributions consist of actual social contributions by employers and households collected as well as imputed social contributions, households' social contribution supplements and social insurance scheme service charges. 'Other current revenues' consist of the categories property income earned, other subsidies on production received and other current transfers. While this latter category is often dominated by other current transfers between different levels of government, these must be consolidated when presenting data for the whole general government.    Total expenditure    Total     expenditure    is calculated as the sum of transactions in the following categories: compensation of employees, intermediate consumption, interest, subsidies, social benefits, other current expenditure, capital transfers and capital investments. The categories 'compensation of employees' and 'intermediate consumption' form part of the cost of production incurred by the government as a producer. The category 'compensation of employees' includes 'wages and salaries paid' and the 'employers' social insurance contributions' (including imputed social contributions). 'Intermediate consumption' contains the goods and services consumed by the government during its production process. Social benefits consist of social benefits other than social transfers in kind (mainly cash transfers) and of social transfers in kind purchased via market producers (such as the provision, paid by government, of medical services by health care providers classified outside the general government sector). The recording of social benefits expenditure does not include social transfers in kind provided by non-market producers within general government, such as medical services provided by hospitals classified within general government or certain types of social housing. This is to avoid counting such expenditures twice (once as social transfers and once as a cost of production) in the calculation of total expenditure. The category 'interest' includes payments on government liabilities on an accrual basis. Interest expenditure does not include fees and charges made under the service component of interest payments; such expenditures are recorded as 'intermediate consumption'. The category 'other current expenditure' is composed of 'other taxes on production', 'property income other than interest', 'current taxes on income, wealth, etc.', 'other current transfers' and the 'adjustment for the change in pension entitlements'. 'Capital transfers' comprise 'investment grants' and 'other capital transfers'. Last in the sequence, the category 'capital investments' includes 'gross fixed capital formation' among other capital transactions. Disposals of non-financial assets are included as negative investments in this category and not on the revenue side.    In summary     government revenue     is the sum of:      ""sales"" consisting of:         market output         output for own final use         payments for          non-market output         ,        taxes on production and imports       ,       other        subsidies on production       ,       property income, receivable       current taxes on income and wealth etc., receivable,       social contributions       ,       other current        transfers       , receivable and       capital transfers, receivable.      Government expenditure     is the sum of:       intermediate consumption       ,       gross capital formation       ,       compensation of employees,       other taxes on production, payable       subsidies       payable,       property income (including interest) payable,       current taxes on income, wealth etc., payable,       social benefits       other than        social transfers       in kind,       social transfers in kind - purchased market production,       other current transfers payable,       adjustment for the change in pension entitlements,       capital transfers, payable and       acquisitions less disposals of        non-financial non-produced assets       .

884;1379;"  The     gender pay gap    , abbreviated as     GPG    , refers to the difference in average wages between men and women. The unadjusted gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between the average gross hourly     earnings    of male and female paid     employees    as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees.    From the reference year 2006 onwards, the GPG is computed annually in the     European Union (EU)    by the     European statistical system (ESS)    according to 3 main guidelines; the GPG is:    unadjusted, i.e. without correcting for national differences in individual characteristics of employed men and women - the main reason is that, at this stage, there is neither consensus nor scientific evidence on which adjustment method should be used;     calculated using gross hourly earnings - this choice aims at excluding from the measurement differences among EU Member States in terms of use of part time work;     based on a harmonised source across the EU, the      Structure of earnings survey (SES)     , a rich employer-employee matched data set.    More specifically, the unadjusted GPG is calculated:    using the four-yearly Structure of earnings survey (SES) as a benchmark, from the 2006 survey onwards;     using national estimates (based on national sources) provided by Member States for the years between the SES benchmark years, from reference year 2007 onwards (same coverage as SES);     defining the GPG as the relative difference between the average (      arithmetic mean     ) gross hourly earnings of women and men, expressed in %;     with the same coverage as the SES:      no restrictions for age and hours worked, part-timers shall be included;       NACE       Rev. 1.1. aggregate for sections C to O, excluding L (section L and the total C to O are optional) ?

885;1380;  The     Structure of earnings survey    , abbreviated as     SES    , is conducted every four years in the Member States of the     European Union (EU)    and provides comparable information at EU level on relationships between the level of     earnings    , individual characteristics of     employees    (sex, age, occupation, length of service,     educational level    ) and their employer (economic activity, size of the enterprise, etc.) for reference years 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 (next survey with reference year 2018).    The data collection is based on legislation and data become available approximately 2 years after the end of the reference period. In the SES     gross annual earnings    cover remuneration in cash and in kind paid during the reference year before any tax deductions and social-security contributions payable by wage earners and retained by the employer. The main difference between annual and monthly earnings in the SES is that annual earnings are not only the sum of the direct remuneration, bonuses and allowances paid to an employee in each pay period. Annual earnings hence usually exceed the figure produced by multiplying the ?standard monthly package? by 12. The ?standard monthly package? includes those bonuses and allowances which occur in every pay period, even if the amount for these ?regular? bonuses and allowances varies, but excludes bonuses and allowances not occurring in every pay period. Furthermore, monthly earnings leave payments in kind out of consideration. However, annual earnings also cover all ?non-standard payments?, i.e. payments not occurring in each pay period, and payments in kind.    The SES covers businesses with at least 10 employees and all economic activities defined in sections B to N, and P to S, of the     Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Communities      (     NACE Rev 2)    .

890;1389;"  The     Kyoto Protocol    , adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, commits 37 industrialized countries and the     European Union    to the so-called     Kyoto target    of reducing their     greenhouse gas    emissions by an average of 5% against 1990 levels, over the 2008-2012 period. At the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference there was an agreement to extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol until 2020.    The Protocol was adopted at the Third Conference of the Parties to the     United Nations    Convention on Climate Change in December 1997 and came into force on 16 February 2005. The main distinction between the Kyoto Protocol and the     Convention    is that while the Convention encouraged industrialized countries to stabilize emissions, the Protocol sets binding targets.    To date, there are 192 parties (191 states and 1 regional economic integration organization, namely the EU) that have ratified the Protocol. Signatories must meet their targets primarily through national measures. However, the Kyoto Protocol offers an additional means of meeting targets through three market-based     Kyoto mechanisms    :    emissions trading (also known as the carbon market);     clean development mechanism (an emission-reduction project in the developing world);     joint implementation (to encourage foreign investment and technology transfer).    These measures are designed to stimulate green investment and help signatories meet their emission targets in a cost-effective manner.    The progress towards the target is calculated in comparison with the level of emissions in a historical year, called the     Kyoto base year    , which for most EU countries is 1990. The collective     EU-15    commitment has a Kyoto base year 1990, while other EU countries have different base years, namely Bulgaria (1988), Hungary (average of 1985-1987), Poland (1988), Romania (1989) and Slovenia (1986). In addition, countries may choose to use 1995 as the base year for total emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride (F-gases), in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 8 of the Protocol. In the EU-27, almost all countries have adopted the year 1995 as a base year for F-gases, except Austria, France, Italy and Slovakia which have 1990.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x8c\x83\xdfs \x00';
891;1390;  The     grazing livestock density index    measures the stock of grazing animals (     cattle    ,     sheep    ,     goats    and     equidae    ) expressed in     livestock units (LSU)    per hectare of     fodder area    .    The fodder area is the sum of fodder brassica's and roots, forage plants and     permanent grassland    (excluding permanent grassland no longer used for production and eliglible for subsidies). In 2007 a new variable Permanent grassland no longer used for production and eliglible for the payment of subsidies was introduced in the FSS to reflect changes to the Common Agricultural Policy, in particular     Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003    . This regulation introduced ?Maintaining the land in good agricultural and environmental condition? as an agricultural activity. Permanent grassland areas maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition no longer used for production became under this regulation eliglible for subsidies and are therefore included in the utilised agricultural area.    Livestock patterns give an indication of the pressure of livestock farming on the environment. Through manure production livestock contributes to     climate change    (     greenhouse gas    emissions) and nutrient leaching into water and air. In contrast with manure of other animal types, the manure of grazing livestock is mainly used for fertilisation of fodder area. Therefore the indicator relates the number of grazing livestock to the fodder area. A higher grazing livestock density means that more manure is available per ha of fodder area, which increases the risk of nutrient leaching. The actual impact on the environment of grazing livestock is however also depending on farmer practices. A higher grazing livestock index therefore does not necessarily means environmental degradation.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dF\xa1\x9f\x03 \x00';

The utilised agricultural area (UAA) is the total area taken up by     arable land    (including temporary grassland and fallow land),     permanent grassland    ,     permanent crops    and     kitchen gardens    . Livestock numbers are converted into livestock units using specific coefficients. A     livestock unit (LSU) is    a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and ages. Eurofarm LSU coefficients are established by convention (originally, they were related to the animals? feed requirements). Livestock units are not calculated for bees and other livestock.    The livestock density index is an indicator for the pressure of livestock farming on the environment. Livestock, through manure production, contributes to     climate change    (     greenhouse gas    emissions) and nutrient leaching into water and air. A higher livestock density means that a higher amount of manure is available per ha of UAA, which increases the risk of nutrient leaching. The actual impact on the environment of livestock farming is not only depending on the amount of livestock, but also depends on farming practices. An increase in the livestock index, therefore does not necessarily needs to lead to environmental degradation.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x88\r@\xf3 \x00';

The reference unit used for the calculation of livestock units (=1 LSU) is the grazing equivalent of one adult     dairy cow    producing 3 000 kg of milk annually, without additional concentrated foodstuffs.

895;1394;"   Wine    is an alcoholic beverage made with the fermented juice of     grapes     . This includes all types of wine made from fresh grapes, including sparkling, fortified and dessert wines.    The concept of EU quality wines is based on a geographical origin approach (quality wine produced in a specified region). Thus, the classification distinguishes between wines with     Geographical indication (GI)    and other wines. Wines with GI are further divided into wines with a     Protected designation of origin (PDO)    and wines with a     Protected geographical indication (PGI)    . For a wine to have a PDO or a PGI, the grapes need to originate in vine areas which comply with the requirements of     Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013    and the corresponding national rules. Grapes should be classified in the category ""PDO"" or in the category ""PGI"", as long as they originate in vine areas which comply with the conditions established in the specifications of a given PDO or PGI, the maximum yield established in the specifications is not surpassed for the respective vine areas and the respective grower decides to use or market those grapes for the production of PDO/PGI wines in a given year.    PDO wine must be produced exclusively with grapes from the area in question, while PGI wines can be made of up to 15% of grapes which do not comply with the above conditions. It is not enough that the grapes are grown in the geographical area of production of a given PDO/PGI, also the yields verified that year and analytical and/or organoleptic elements have to be respected.    If the grapes originate in areas which comply with the specifications of both PDO and PGI, the maximum yields are respected and the respective grower decides to use or market those grapes for the production of PDO and PGI wines in a given year, it shall be included only as ""PDO"" in order to avoid double counting.

Extrapolation may be valid where the present circumstances give no indication of any interruption in long-established past     trends    . However, a straight-line extrapolation (assuming a short-term trend is to continue far into the future) is fraught with risk because some unforeseeable factors almost always intervene.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa5a\xd5\xf2 \x00';
914;1423;   Targeted internet advertising    focuses on using - internet based - technologies that increase the likelihood of promotional marketing messages reaching the right audience. Targeted internet advertising includes     dynamic ads    using various methods such as online     contextual advertising    ,     behavioural targeting    and     geo-targeting    as well as the use of     static ads    on subject-specific websites (e.g. displaying ads on spare parts of car engines on websites on vehicles or automotive themes) or websites such as online newspapers, magazines or blogs for specific audience.    Online     contextual advertising    is a type of     targeted internet advertising    that uses technologies embedded in websites and apps that choose ads based on the content of the web pages internet surfers view. Internet users are presented with adverts that automated systems (ad servers) have selected for them based on the content of the webpage they are browsing. Similarly,     contextual advertising    can be based on the specific keywords used in the user's latest query from the same device.    Behavioural targeting    is a form of     targeted internet advertising    , based on information about users? past browsing activities recorded by cookies. Businesses may use this information to determine whether an internet user belongs to a specific target audience, subsequently sending internet ads matching the user?s profile.    Geo-targeting    is a type of     targeted internet advertising    that refers to the use of internet users' geographic location such as the country, region, city and often zip code that provide useful information for targeting suitable advertisements, for example about restaurants nearby.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dH\xe5\xfa\x14 \x00';

916;1428;"  The     Statistical classification of products by activity    , abbreviated as     CPA    , is the classification of products (goods as well as services) at the level of the     European Union (EU)    .    Product classifications are designed to categorize products that have common characteristics. They provide the basis for collecting and calculating statistics on the production,     distributive trade    , consumption, international trade and transport of such products.    CPA product categories are related to activities as defined by the     Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE)    . Each CPA product - whether a transportable or non-transportable good or a service - is assigned to one single NACE activity. This linkage to NACE activities gives the CPA a structure parallel to that of NACE at all levels.    The CPA is part of an integrated system of statistical classifications, developed mainly under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Division. This system makes it possible to compare statistics across countries and in different statistical domains.    CPA has a hierarchical structure with six levels, each identified with a specific code:    first level: 21      sections     (alphabetical code);     second level: 88      divisions     (two-digit numerical code);     third level: 261      groups     (three-digit numerical code);     fourth level: 575      classes     (four-digit numerical code);     fifth level: 1 342      categories     (five-digit numerical code);     sixth level: 3 142      subcategories     (six-digit numerical code).

International sourcing    is sourcing to affiliated or non-affiliated enterprises located abroad. This definition excludes, however, the movement of core or support business functions abroad without a reduction of activity and/or jobs in the enterprise concerned - for example, if a new production line is set up abroad without reductions, even if the line also could have been set up in the country for which statistics are compiled, then this does not constitute international sourcing.

923;1445;  The     international investment position (IIP)    is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of:    - external     financial assets    of residents of an economy that are claims on non-residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and    - external     financial liabilities    of residents of an economy to non-residents.    The difference between an economy?s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy?s     net international investment position (NIIP)    , which may be positive or negative. Respectively, the NIIP provides an aggregate view of the net financial position (assets minus liabilities) of a country via-à-vis the rest of the world. A positive NIIP (assets higher than liabilities) qualifies an economy as net creditor, a negative NIIP (liabilities higher than assets) as net debtor nation, allowing for measuring the extent of external financial exposure of a country.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dI\xb8\xdb\x8d \x00';
924;1448;   Residence    in the context of balance of payments is determined by an entity?s centre of predominant economic interest. As a general guideline it is sufficient to qualify as resident when being present in a territory for one year or more.    Migrants    going abroad with the intention to stay and work for one year or longer will accordingly become residents of the host economy.    On the contrary, short trips below one year for recreation or work do not lead to a change in residence. Workers employed under contracts below one year (     seasonal workers    ) or non-residents who commute to work into another economy (     border workers    ) are not considered residents of the host economy, where they are employed.    The criterion of residence is used in balance of payments statistics to determine whether a transaction is relevant for being registered or not. In this context it has to be highlighted that only transactions     between residents and non-residents    are relevant in the balance of payments, thus excluding all economic activities which are conducted only between residents of an economy (or between non-residents for that sake).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dktd\xcc \x00';

There can be different reasons for setting up a SPE:    to protect a company from financial risk, often in the context of a large project;     to separate different layers of equity infusion in complex financing operations;     to own and more easily dispose of assets and associated permits and rights;     to engage in a public-private partnership relying on a project-finance structure.    As there is no universally accepted definition of a special-purpose entity yet, not all of the above-mentioned characteristics or reasons have to be applied to be called such.

The SHA provides a standard framework for producing a set of comprehensive, consistent and internationally comparable accounts to meet the needs of public and private sector health analysts and policy-makers. At present, national health accounts are at different stages of development and may not only differ in the boundaries drawn between health and other social and economic activities but also in the classifications used, the level of detail provided, and in the accounting rules. The SHA provides a framework for a family of interrelated tables for standard reporting for expenditure (spending) on health and for its financing. It has been written with the dual aim of providing this framework for international data collections and as a possible model for redesigning and complementing national health accounts to aid policy-makers.    The demand for improved health accounts is driven by an increasing complexity of healthcare systems in many countries and the rapid evolution in medical technology. Policy-makers and observers of healthcare systems and recent reforms have questioned the adequacy of accounting practices and the ability of health accounts to monitor fast-changing healthcare systems that are becoming increasingly complex. Raising consumers? expectations of healthcare contributes to the demand for up-to-date information on healthcare systems.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d_<\x0b\xec \x00';

Its members are represented through a quota system broadly based on their relative size in the global economy.    The IMF promotes international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, facilitates the balanced growth of international trade, and provides resources to help members in balance of payments difficulties or to assist with poverty reduction. Through its economic surveillance, the IMF keeps track of the economic health of its member countries, alerting them to risks on the horizon and providing policy advice.

Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as     million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents    , abbreviated as     MMTCDE    .    The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tonnes of the gas by the associated GWP:    MMTCDE = (million metric tonnes of a gas) * (GWP of the gas).    For example, the GWP for methane is 25 and for nitrous oxide 298. This means that emissions of 1 million metric tonnes of methane and nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 25 and 298 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dL\xb7\x1c\xd6 \x00';
961;1509;  The     minimum wage    is the lowest wage that employers are legally obliged to pay their     employees    . The basic national minimum wage can be fixed at an hourly, weekly or monthly rate, and this minimum wage is enforced by law (the government), often after consultation with the social partners, or directly by national intersectoral agreement (in the     European Union (EU)    this is the case for Belgium and Greece).    The national minimum wage usually applies to all employees, or at least to a large majority of employees in the country. Some countries have exceptions for e.g. younger workers, apprentices or workers with disabilities. Gross amounts are reported, that is, before income tax and     social security deductions    , which vary between countries.    Minimum wage laws contain provisions for regular reviews of the rate, often involving tripartite negotiations among government, unions and employers, to reflect changes in prices, wages and other economic factors. The minimum wage may be subject to automatic reassessment (indexed to the     consumer price index    or economic growth) or to discretionary increases (via legislation).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dL\xd2|\xc7 \x00';
962;1511;"   Population change    , defined generally, is the difference in the size of a population between the end and the beginning of a given time period (usually one year). Specifically, it is the difference in population size on 1 January of two consecutive years.    Population change has two components:     natural population change     (the number of      live births     minus the number of      deaths     );     net migration     (the number of      immigrants     minus the number of      emigrants     , plus statistical adjustment ? it should be noted that net migration as referred to in the context of population change statistics includes the statistical adjustments occurring in the annual balance of the population and that it serves the purpose of closing this balance).    A positive population change, when the result of net migration plus live births minus deaths is positive, is referred to as     population growth    , a negative one is called a     population decrease    .    The     crude rate of population growth    is the ratio of total population growth during the year to the average population of the area in question that year.

967;1519;  The     population figure    , or     total population    or simply     population    , of a given area is the total number of people in that area at a given time.    For the population figures compiled by     Eurostat    from the data provided by     European Union (EU)    Member States, that time is     1      st     January    and the resulting figure is called     population on 1 January    . The recommended definition is the     usual resident population    , representing the number of inhabitants of a given area on 1     st    January of the year in question (or, in some cases, on 31     st    December of the previous year). The population can be based on data from the most recent     census    adjusted by the components of     population change    produced since the last census, or based on population registers.    The     average population during a calendar year    is calculated as the     arithmetic mean    of the population on 1     st    January of two consecutive years.

974;1528;"   Pig farming    or     pig husbandry    , the raising of     pigs    for meat, may be organized in a more or less sophisticated way, but it can always be analyzed on the basis of the production cycle and is divided into two parts:    farrowing sows for the production of weaned piglets;     the rearing of those piglets, as future breeding animals or as pigs for slaughtering.    In a non-organized sector the genetic selection is managed within each herd, with the breeding animals being kept from the grown pigs (gilts) or purchased outside (boars) and used for natural service.    In a more sophisticated organisation the breeding animals are produced in specialized farms taking part in a thorough selection scheme (nucleus-multipliers-breeders). The sows are usually inseminated artificially and patch farrowed. Depending on the efficiency of the selection scheme, the pig fattening performance is improved. The functions of breeders, farrowers and fatteners can be combined and the fattening can be divided into growing and finishing.    The housing of pigs may vary from confined buildings for rapid standardized production to outdoor extensive production, as well as all the forms of organization in between. Most of the production is conducted according to optimized intensive methods, and extensive farming may either be in response to consumer demand (e.g.     organic farming    ) or be used for own consumption. In such cases, the piglets grown and fattened in winter make use of     cereals    , food waste, by-products, buildings or labour force.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dM\xc68\xb5 \x00';

977;1533;  The     price level index    , abbreviated as     PLI    , expresses the price level of a given country relative to another (or relative to a group of countries like the European Union), by dividing the     Purchasing power parities (PPPs)    by the current nominal     exchange rate    .    If the price level index of a country is higher than 100, the country concerned is relatively expensive compared to the one to which it is compared (for example the EU), while if the price level index is lower than 100, then the country is relatively inexpensive compared to the other country.    Price level indices are not intended to rank countries strictly. In fact, they only provide an indication of the order of magnitude of the price level in one country in relation to others, particularly when countries are clustered around a very narrow range of outcomes. The degree of uncertainty associated with the basic price data and the methods used for compiling PPPs, may affect in such a case the minor differences between the PLIs and result in differences in ranking which are not statistically or economically significant.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dM\xf5lX \x00';

A     nominal effective exchange rate    is the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-à-vis (as compared with) other currencies weighted by their share in either the country?s international trade or payments.    Real effective exchange rates    take account of price level differences between trading partners. Movements in real effective exchange rates give an indication of the evolution of a country?s aggregate (total) external price competitiveness.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa6x5\x1b \x00';

983;1539;  The need to distinguish different types of housing for pigs such as slatted floor vs. partially slatted floor is due to different ammonia emissions that can be accounted for either system. In what respects N     2    O emissions, however, this distinction is not as relevant, as both slatted and partly slatted floors are operated as pit stores under animal confinement (     IPCC, 2006    ).    Slatted floor housing    refers to     animal houses    where the floors can be:     partially slatted     : part of the floor has slats where the manure and urine drop down below the floor into a pit, where they form slurry     completely slatted     : the whole floor has slats where the manure and urine drop down below the floor into a pit, where they form slurry     Solid floor housing (excluding deep litter)    refers to a flat, solid floor usually made from non-polished cement (to avoid slipping) or hard soil. The floor normally slopes away to the rear to make cleaning easier.    Pig housing on straw-beds    (deep litter-loose housing) refers to animal houses where the floor is covered with a thick layer of litter (straw, peat, sawdust, or other similar material binding the manure and urine) that is removed only at intervals that may be several months apart.    Other types of housing    are types of housing different from the ones mentioned above.    Free range    is a method of farming husbandry where the animals, for at least part of the day, can roam freely outdoor, rather than being confined in an enclosure for 24 hours each day. For the purpose of Integrated Farm Statistics it is not requested that the animals are always outdoors to consider them as free range. Some free range systems assume that animals come to a sheltered area at the end of the day.    Exercise yards    are outdoor areas, normally with impermeable floor, where animals can exercise for part of the day.

987;1544;"   Pig farming    or     pig husbandry    , the raising of     pigs    for meat, may be organized in a more or less sophisticated way, but it can always be analyzed on the basis of the production cycle and is divided into two parts:    farrowing sows for the production of weaned piglets;     the rearing of those piglets, as future breeding animals or as pigs for slaughtering.    In a non-organized sector the genetic selection is managed within each herd, with the breeding animals being kept from the grown pigs (gilts) or purchased outside (boars) and used for natural service.    In a more sophisticated organisation the breeding animals are produced in specialized farms taking part in a thorough selection scheme (nucleus-multipliers-breeders). The sows are usually inseminated artificially and patch farrowed. Depending on the efficiency of the selection scheme, the pig fattening performance is improved. The functions of breeders, farrowers and fatteners can be combined and the fattening can be divided into growing and finishing.    The housing of pigs may vary from confined buildings for rapid standardized production to outdoor extensive production, as well as all the forms of organization in between. Most of the production is conducted according to optimized intensive methods, and extensive farming may either be in response to consumer demand (e.g.     organic farming    ) or be used for own consumption. In such cases, the piglets grown and fattened in winter make use of     cereals    , food waste, by-products, buildings or labour force.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dNm\x99\xd0 \x00';

The total number of decisions consists of the sum of positive and negative decisions.

Over time, satellite accounts for particular fields have come to be associated with the following characteristics:    They feature data for a whole field of economic activity and provide a framework for arraying more comprehensive information about a field than can be shown in the main accounts.     They are purpose-oriented in that the criterion for a transactor's or transaction's inclusion is its linkage to the field.     They are articulated with the main accounts and contain at least one measure that is also in the main accounts.     They present information in ways that are different from the main accounts: definitions, classifications, and accounting conventions may differ from those used in the main accounts in order to provide the most useful presentation of information about the field. What is counted as current or capital in the main accounts may be changed, or the boundary of production may be moved. The definitions, classifications, and accounting conventions must be consistent within the account, however.     They often contain tables that answer several questions: Who is producing, and what are the means of production? Who is financing? What is the result of the expense, and who is benefiting or using the result?     They often encompass monetary and physical data in an integrated fashion. Physical data may relate to production, for example, the number of persons employed in the field of the stocks of equipment. Physical data may also relate to beneficiaries, for example, the number of persons being affected by activities in the field.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dO\x97B\xca \x00';

Satellite accounts are one way in which the System of National Accounts may be adapted to meet differing circumstances and needs. They are closely linked to the main system but are not bound to employ exactly the same concepts or restrict themselves to data expressed in monetary terms. Satellite accounts are intended for special purposes such as monitoring the community's health or the state of the environment. They may also be used to explore new methodologies and to work out new accounting procedures that, when fully developed and accepted, might become absorbed into the main system over time.

European Union (EU)    Member States could choose whether to carry out the SAPM as a sample survey or as a     census    survey. Data were collected on tillage methods, soil conservation, landscape features, animal grazing, animal housing, manure application, manure storage and treatment facilities and irrigation. With reference to irrigation, Member States were asked to provide estimation (possibly by means of models) of the volume of water used for irrigation on the     agricultural holding    . Detailed information on the set up of the survey and the characteristics surveyed can be found in the background article on the     Survey on agricultural production methods    .    Bulgaria, Czechia, Romania, Montenegro, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Slovakia carried the SAPM out as a census survey, while Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia carried the SAPM out as a sample survey. Sample sizes varied from ca 3% to one-third of agricultural holdings. Though sample sizes may vary accross countries the level of precision is guaranteed for certain characteristics surveyed by the precision requirements laid down in Annex IV of     Regulation 1166/2008    .    The Member States collected information from individual agricultural holdings and, observing rules of confidentiality, data were transmitted to     Eurostat    . The results of the SAPM are linked at the level of individual agricultural holdings to the data obtained from the     Farm structure survey (FSS)    in 2010. The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (Member States, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the SAPM is the agricultural holding: a technical-economic unit, under single management, engaged in agricultural production. The SAPM covers all agricultural holdings with a     utilised agricultural area (UAA)    of at least one hectare (ha) and also those holdings with a UAA of less than 1 ha where their market production exceeds certain natural thresholds. The legal basis for the SAPM is Regulation 1166/2008 of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the Survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation 571/88    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dP\x88\xf6` \x00';

The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to     NUTS    3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a     census    .    The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia.    In 2010 a special survey, the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat.    The countries collect information from individual     agricultural holdings    and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to     Eurostat    . The information collected in the FSS covered     land use    , livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on     Farm structure survey - thresholds    .    The legal basis for the FSS was     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88    .

1012;1581;"  The     standard output    of an agricultural product (crop or livestock), abbreviated as     SO    , is the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare or per head of livestock.    There is a regional SO coefficient for each product, as an average value over a reference period (5 years, except for the SO 2004 coefficient calculated using the average of 3 years). The sum of all the SO per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall     economic size    , expressed in euro.    The standard output is used to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size.    The common classification of holdings is built on different nested levels. Homogeneous groups of holdings can be assembled in a greater or lower degree of aggregation. Depending on the amount of details required, the types of farming are divided into :    general types of farming (1 digit),      principal types of farming (2 digits),        particular types of farming (3 digits), in earlier years in a few cases split into subdivisions of          particular types of farming (4 digits).       Table 1 shows the changes in the classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming between the Farm structure surveys 1985 and 2016.     Table 1: Classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming and by survey year      Until 2007 the     Farm structure survey (FSS    ) and the Farm accountancy data network (FADN) have used     standard gross margin (SGM)    to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size (     Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985    ). From FSS 2010 this classification uses standard output (SO) instead of SGM according to     Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008    , which is replaced by     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014    for FSS 2016 and onwards.    The principle of both concepts SGM and SO is the same; only the way they are calculated differs:    SGM = Output + Direct Payments ? Costs     SO= Output    The decision to leave SGM was driven by the     CAP    moving from coupled to decoupled payments. Since decoupled direct payments cannot be attributed to any specific production, they were excluded from the calculation. If the cost were kept in the calculation there would be the possibility of negative SGM values in cases where costs were higher that the output. Therefore only the output is taken into account.    The main differences between SO and SGM are:    SO excludes direct payments and includes the production costs;     the fodder requirement in the case of some livestock characteristics is included in the calculation of the SO;     the unit used to measure SO is the euro and not      ESU     (1 200 Euro) as in the SGM classification.    The farm structure survey online database is only available from 1990 onwards.    Figure 1 shows the use of SO and SGM coefficients in Farm structure surveys in the period 1990-2016.

1021;1592;"   Labour cost    or     total labour cost    is the total expenditure borne by employers for employing staff.    Total labour cost consists of:    employee compensation (including wages, salaries in cash and in kind, employers?      social security contributions     );     vocational training     costs;     other expenditure such as recruitment costs, spending on working clothes and employment taxes regarded as labour costs;     minus any subsidies received.     Eurostat    publishes     annually    the following three core indicators:     average monthly labour cost     : total labour cost per month divided by the corresponding number of      employees     (including apprentices), expressed as      full-time equivalents     ;     average hourly labour cost     : total labour cost divided by the corresponding number of hours worked;     structure of labour cost     : wages and salaries, employers? social security contributions and other labour costs, expressed as a percentage of total labour cost.    Beside this annual labour cost data collection, Eurostat also publishes the detailed results of the four-yearly     Labour cost survey (LCS)    and the series of the quarterly labour cost index (LCI).    The Eurostat definition closely follows the international one laid down by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (Geneva, 1966) in its     resolution on the statistics of labour cost    .    The labour cost includes both direct and indirect costs.    Direct costs (compensation of employees):      gross wages and salaries paid in cash;       direct remuneration (pay) and bonuses;       wages and salaries in kind (company products, housing, company cars, meal vouchers, crèches, etc.).      Direct costs are dominated by wages and salaries paid in cash.     Indirect costs:      employers?        actual social contributions       (i.e. statutory, collectively agreed, contractual and voluntary social security contributions);       employers?        imputed social contributions       (mostly guaranteed pay in the event of sickness or short-time working, plus severance pay and compensation instead of notice);       vocational training       costs;       recruitment costs and work clothes given by the employer;       taxes paid by the employer (based on their wages and salaries bill or on the numbers they employ)       minus subsidies received by the employer (intended to refund part or all of the cost of direct pay).

1022;1593;  The     population figure    , or     total population    or simply     population    , of a given area is the total number of people in that area at a given time.    For the population figures compiled by     Eurostat    from the data provided by     European Union (EU)    Member States, that time is     1      st     January    and the resulting figure is called     population on 1 January    .

The population can be based on data from the most recent     census    adjusted by the components of     population change    produced since the last census, or based on population registers.    The     average population during a calendar year    is calculated as the     arithmetic mean    of the population on 1     st    January of two consecutive years. The average population is further used in the calculation of demographic indicators, like the crude rates per 1 000 inhabitants, and for some '     per capita    ' indicators.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dQ\xa0vE \x00';
1023;1594;  Colloquially put,     total revenue    is all the income a government receives. More formally, total revenue is the aggregate of all transactions recorded under resources in the ESA framework, including subsidies receivable in the current accounts and capital transfers receivable recorded in the capital account.    A     revenue transaction is one that increases net worth    . Revenue is presented in the tables as the sum of taxes, net social contributions, sales (defined as market output, output for own final use and payments for non-market production), other current revenues and capital transfer revenues. Total taxes are composed of taxes on production and imports (so-called indirect taxes), current taxes on income and wealth (direct taxes), and capital taxes (some classifications of taxes include capital taxes as a component of direct taxes). Net social contributions consist of actual social contributions by employers and households collected as well as imputed social contributions, households' social contribution supplements and social insurance scheme service charges. 'Other current revenues' consist of the categories property income earned, other subsidies on production received and other current transfers.    Summarising,     total revenue of general government is defined in ESA 2010    (8.100 and chapter 20) as comprising the following categories of the     European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010)    :     market output     output for own final use     payments for non-market production     taxes on production and imports     other subsidies on production, receivable     property income     current taxes on income, wealth, etc.     net social contributions     other current      transfers     capital transfers  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dQ\xb7\xb6S \x00';
1024;1595;"   Tax revenue    is typically the major source of government revenue. In national accounts, taxes are defined as compulsory, unrequited payments levied by general government - or in a few cases by the EU institutions. Tax revenue includes taxes on production and imports, current taxes on income, wealth, etc., capital taxes and social contributions.    Overview and definition    Total tax revenue is an aggregate comprising:     taxes on production and imports     , such as      value added tax (VAT)     , import duties, excise duties and consumption taxes, stamp taxes, payroll taxes, taxes on pollution, and others;     current taxes on income, wealth, etc.     , such as corporate and personal income taxes, taxes on holding gains, payments by households for licences to own or use cars, hunt or fish, current taxes on capital that are paid periodically, and others;     capital taxes     , such as inheritance taxes, death duties and taxes on gifts and capital levies that are occasional or exceptional;      actual social contributions      paid on a compulsory or voluntary basis by employers or      employees     or the      self-     or non-employed to insure against social risks (sickness, invalidity, disability, old age, survivors, family and maternity);      imputed (or implicit) social contributions      payable under unfunded social insurance schemes (in which employers pay social benefits to their employees, ex-employees or their dependants out of their own resources without creating special reserve for the purpose).     households' social contribution supplements less social insurance scheme service charges.    The calculation of total tax revenue must be reduced by the amount of     taxes and social contributions assessed as unlikely to be collected    .    Taxes may be classified as indirect taxes, such as taxes on production and imports, and direct taxes, such as taxes on income and wealth and capital gains tax, according to the     European system of national and regional accounts    .    Time of recording    According to ESA2010, taxes and social contributions should be recorded on an accrual basis. ESA2010 details the rules to be followed on the     time of recording    and the amounts to be recorded. Two methods can be used:    'time-adjusted' cash ? the cash is attributed when the activity took place to generate the tax liability or when the amount of taxes was determined in the case of some income taxes. This adjustment may be based on the average time difference between the activity and cash receipt;     a method based on declarations and assessments. In this case, an adjustment needs to be made for amounts assessed or declared but unlikely to be collected. These amounts have to be eliminated from government revenue, either by using a tax-specific coefficient based on past experience and future expectations or by recording a capital transfer for the same adjustment (ESA2010 code D.995) to the relevant sectors.     ESA2010 classifications and codes     D.2: TAXES ON PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS     D.21: Taxes on products     D.211: Value added type taxes (VAT)     D.212: Taxes and duties on imports excluding VAT     D.214: Taxes on products, except VAT and import taxes     D.29: Other taxes on production     D.5: CURRENT TAXES ON INCOME, WEALTH, ETC.

Tax revenue by economic function    An alternative classification of taxes may be made according to their economic function. Since this split does not correspond fully with the national accounts (ESA 2010 and SNA 08) breakdown of taxes, it is undertaken specifically for each Member State of the     European Union (EU)    annually. The results are published in a report entitled 'Taxation trends in the European Union. Data for the EU Member States and Norway'.    Breakdown of taxes by economic function    (based on the sources mentioned above) is as follows:     taxes on consumption     , i.e. levied on transactions between final consumers and producers and on the final consumption goods, such as VAT, taxes and duties on imports excluding VAT, stamp taxes, taxes on financial and capital transactions, taxes on international transactions, on pollution, under-compensation of VAT, poll and expenditure taxes, payments by households for licences;     taxes on labour     ? on employed labour, i.e. taxes directly linked to wages and mostly withheld at source, paid by employees and employers, including compulsory social contributions and on non-employed labour income, i.e. all taxes and compulsory social contributions raised on transfer income of non-employed people, where these could be identified (e.g. unemployment and healthcare benefits);     taxes on capital     ? defined as taxes on capital and business income that economic agents earn or receive from domestic resources or from abroad (e.g. corporate income tax, tax on income and social contributions of the self-employed, taxes on holding gains) and taxes on capital stock that include the wealth tax (paid periodically on the ownership and use of land or buildings by owners, and current taxes on net wealth and on other assets, such as jewellery and other external signs of wealth), capital taxes, real estate tax, taxes on use of fixed assets, professional and business licences and some taxes on products.     Implicit tax rates    measure the actual or effective tax burden levied on different types of economic income or activities that could potentially be taxed. They are computed as the ratio of total tax revenues of the specific economic category (consumption, labour and capital) to a proxy of the potential tax base defined using the production and income accounts of national accounts.

In contrast with other offences, the counting unit for homicide is normally the victim rather than the case.

The WTO also has several candidate members in the process of joining.    The WTO is the only global international organisation dealing with the rules of trade between nations. WTO sets the global rules for trade, providing a forum for trade negotiations and for settling disputes between WTO members.    At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the vast majority of the world?s trading nations and ratified in their national parliaments. The WTO's goal is to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers conduct their business effectively and efficiently on a global basis.

The     work intensity    of a household is the ratio of the total number of months that all working-age household members have worked during the income     reference year    and the total number of months the same household members theoretically could have worked in the same period.    A working-age person is a person aged 18-59 years, with the exclusion of students in the age group between 18 and 24 years.

A     waterway    is a river, canal, lake or other stretch of water, that is not part of the sea, which through natural or man-made features is suitable for navigation. This term includes both navigable rivers and lakes and navigable canals. The length of rivers and canals is measured in mid-channel. The length of lakes and lagoons is measured along the shortest navigable route between the two most distant points that perform transport operations. A waterway forming a common frontier between two countries is reported by both states.

1070;1665;"  The (industrial)     producer price index    , abbreviated as     PPI    and also called     output price index    , is a     business-cycle    indicator showing the development of transaction prices for the monthly industrial output of economic activities.    The PPI does not only serve as an early indicator of     inflationary    pressures in the economy before it reaches the consumer, but it can also record the evolution of prices over longer time periods.    The PPI for a specific     economic activity    measures the monthly change in the trading price of products and related services. The PPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the seller's perspective. The prices collected in period     t    should refer to orders booked during period     t    (at the moment of the order) and not the moment when the commodities leave the factory gates. Price indices are calculated as a     weighted    average of the relevant products.    PPIs are calculated for the total, the     domestic    and the     non-domestic    markets, with the latter further split between     euro area     and     non-euro area    markets. The indicators of domestic and non-domestic prices require separate producer price indices to be compiled according to the destination of the product. The residency of the third party which has ordered or bought the product defines the destination. The domestic market is defined as all third parties ordering or buying which are residents in the same national territory as the     observation unit    from which sales or orders are collected. When combined, the sub-indices for the domestic and the non-domestic markets give the total change in the PPI for a given product.    The appropriate price for calculating the PPI is the basic price that excludes     VAT    and similar deductible taxes which are directly linked to     turnover    , as well as all duties and taxes on the goods and services invoiced. However, subsidies on products received by the producer, if there are any, should be added to the basic price.    All price-determining characteristics should be taken into account, including the:    quantity of units sold;     transport provided;     rebates;     service conditions;     guarantee conditions;     destination.

Conceptually the index shows changes in the volume of construction, i.e. the price adjusted change in the     value added    to the economy by this sector. As this statistical concept is not directly measurable, the indicator is approximated by several other measures.    Mathematically the index is calculated as a     Laspeyres volume index    .

1121;1734;   Coverage    , is the extent to which the real, observed population matches the ideal or normative population. A population is the domain from which     observations    for a particular topic can be drawn.    Under-coverage    results from the omission of units belonging to the target population, while     over-coverage    occurs due to the inclusion of elements that do not belong to the target population. For instance, for     causes of death    statistics, all deaths of residents occurring in a given year should be covered. However, information about residents dying abroad might not be included in all countries (resulting in under-coverage), and deaths of non-residents might be included (resulting in over-coverage).    An understanding of coverage is required to facilitate the comparison of data. Coverage issues are often explained through the use of tables showing linkages (e.g. part or full correspondence) and can also be used to explain the ratio of coverage. The rules and conventions of coverage are largely determined by concept definitions, scope rules, information requirements and, in the case of statistical collections and classifications, collection and counting units and the collection methodology.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dYb\x8d\xd5 \x00';

1126;1740;"  For the purpose of agricultural statistics the relevant types of     manure application    are:     Broadcast     - Broadcasting can be used for the application of solid, slurry and liquid manure. Application techniques include box spreaders, tank wagons, tow hoses, and irrigation systems. Broadcasting requires the least amount of energy and time, and results in a uniform application pattern. However, surface broadcasting promotes loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere, and the organic fraction decays slowly on the soil surface. The manure could also be mechanically incorporated.     Band spread     - Band spreading is the placement of fertilizer in a concentrated layer or location (band) in the soil, commonly 8-15 cm below the surface. Fertilizer bands can be placed with the seed, below the seed, or both. Surface banding requires half the power of injection units to pull around the field. Also, there is no root pruning with banding, unlike with injectors. Placing manure on the soil surface where it is exposed to sun and air may also reduce pathogens. Trailing hose and trailing shoe are types of band spreaders.     Trailing hose     - Slurry is discharged at ground level to grass or arable land through a series of flexible hoses. Application between the rows of a growing crop is feasible (CLRTAP, 2014).     Trailing shoe     - Slurry is normally discharged through rigid pipes which terminate in metal ""shoes"" designed to ride along the soil surface, parting the crop so that slurry is applied directly to the soil surface and below the crop canopy. Some types of trailing shoes are designed to cut a shallow slit in the soil to aid infiltration (CLRTAP, 2014).     Injection of manure     - Injection methods are beneficial as they place liquid manure below the soil surface, eliminating both surface runoff on sloping soils, and volatilization of ammonia from the manure on any soil. It also reduces odour. However, injection can significantly increase loss of nitrogen by denitrification and leaching to groundwater. Injection equipment can be added to liquid and slurry spreaders. The following types of injection can be distinguished:       shallow injection       : the application of liquid manure by placement in shallow, vertical slots, typically about 50mm deep and 25-30 cm apart, cut into the soil by a tine or disc; they are more commonly used on grassland       deep injection       : the application of slurry or liquid manure by placement in deep, vertical slots, typically about 150mm deep, cut into the soil by specially designed tines; the tines are fitted with lateral wings which aid the dispersion in the soil; typically these are used on arable land as they have an increased risk of physically damaging the grass swards (CLRTAP, 2014)   ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dY\xbcL\xa7 \x00';
1127;1741;   Immediate incorporation of manure    consists of techniques which allow an immediate incorporation of     solid dung    or     slurry    .

1131;1745;  Any time a data pattern changes direction it can be described as having reached a     turning point    . For seasonal patterns these turning points are usually very predictable and can be handled by many different     forecasting    methods because the length of a complete season remains constant. In many cyclical data patterns the length of the cycle varies as does its magnitude. Here the identification of turning points is a particularly difficult and important task.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dZ\x00\x81\xb2 \x00';
1132;1746;"  A     trend    is the slow variation over a longer period of time, usually several years, generally associated with the structural causes affecting the phenomenon being measured. It is the variation left after     time series analysis    has removed accidental (irregular or random),     working-day    and     seasonal    variation from a     time series    .    In some cases, the trend shows a steady growth; in others, it may move either downwards or upwards. The cycle is a quasi (almost but not quite) periodic oscillation. It is characterized by alternating periods of higher and lower rates of change, possibly, but not always, involving expansion and contraction. In most cases, the trend is related to fluctuations in overall economic activity.    Generally, if the irregular part of the time series is relatively important, the trend cycle series is a better series for the analysis of longer-term past developments. However, this advantage is less clear when analyzing recent developments. This is because trend-cycle values for recent periods may undergo greater revisions (changes) than the     seasonally adjusted values    . Hence, the latter may be more suitable for the analysis of recent developments; this is particularly true around turning points. Trend-cycle series may, however, converge to stable results more quickly than seasonally adjusted series.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dZ\x11w\xa3 \x00';

The indicator includes     non-resident    citizens of this destination country, but excludes foreign residents in the given country. A     tourist    is any visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation.    This definition, used in the context of '     European Neighbourhood Policy    - South' (or Southern Mediterranean) statistics, diverges somewhat from the one used in     European Union     tourism statistics    . For the latter, an arrival at a     tourism establishment    is defined as a     tourist    ,     resident    or     non-resident    of the country where the establishment is located, who arrives at a     tourist accommodation establishment (rented-accommodation)    or at     non-rented accommodation    (data for the latter are not collected in the scope of the Tourism Regulation, however).

Gestational age is expressed in completed days or completed weeks (e.g. events occurring 280 to 286 completed days after the onset of the last normal menstrual period are considered to have occurred at 40 weeks of gestation).    Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion, when calculations are based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day zero and not day one; days 0-6 therefore correspond to ?completed week zero?; days 7-13 to ?completed week one?; and the 40th week of actual gestation is synonymous with ?completed week 39?.    Where the date of the last normal menstrual period is not available, gestational age should be based on the best clinical estimate. In order to avoid misunderstanding, tabulations should indicate both weeks and days.    Different gestational age groups can be distinguished, compared to the normal time period before giving birth:     pre-term     : less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation;     term     : From 37 completed weeks to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days) of gestation;     post-term     : 42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more) of gestation.

Asylum decisions can be distinguished according to the     stage in the procedure    when they are taken:     First instance decision     means a decision granted by the respective authority acting as a first instance of the administrative/judicial asylum procedure in the receiving country.     Final decision     means a decision on whether the third-country national or stateless person be granted refugee or subsidiary protection status by virtue of      Directive 2011/95/EU     and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive, irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the Member States concerned pending its outcome. The asylum procedures and the numbers/levels of decision making bodies differ between Member States. The true 'final instance' may be, according to the national legislation and administrative procedures, a decision of the highest national court. However, it is not intended that these statistics should cover rare or exceptional cases determined by the highest courts. Thus, the statistics related to the 'final decisions' should refer to decisions against which there is no further possibility to appeal on the substance of the decision but only on procedural grounds.    For the purpose of the Asylum data collection the concepts of first instance decision and final decision include also data on decisions granting or rejecting 'Humanitarian status' under national law concerning international protection.    Depending on the     outcome    of the decisions, asylum applicants can be categorised in different groups:     Person being a subject of a pending application     means a person who is the subject of an application for international protection under consideration by the responsible national authority at the end of the reference period. It includes the number of persons with pending applications at all instances of the administrative and/or judicial procedure.     Person granted refugee status     means a person covered by a decision granting      refugee     status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Refugee status means status as defined in Art.2(e) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     within the meaning of Art.1 of the      Geneva Convention     relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the      New York Protocol     of 31 January 1967.     Person granted subsidiary protection status     means a person covered by a decision granting subsidiary protection status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Subsidiary protection status means status as defined in Art.2(g) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     . According to Art.2(f) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     a person eligible for subsidiary protection means a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as defined in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) does not apply, and is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.     Person granted authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons     means a person covered by a decision granting authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons under national law concerning international protection, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. It includes persons who are not eligible for international protection as currently defined in the first stage legal instruments, but are nonetheless protected against removal under the obligations that are imposed on all Member States by international refugee or human rights instruments or on the basis of principles flowing from such instruments. Examples of such categories include persons who are not removable on ill health grounds and unaccompanied minors.     Person granted temporary protection     means a person covered by a decision granting temporary protection as defined in Art.2(a) of      Council Directive 2001/55/EC     i.e. 'a procedure of exceptional character to provide, in the event of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such persons, in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process this influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation, in the interests of the persons concerned and other persons requesting protection'.     Rejected applicant     means a person covered by a decision rejecting an application for international protection, including decisions considering applications as inadmissible or as unfounded and decisions under priority and accelerated procedures, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period.    Eurostat further produces aggregates of the     Total number of decisions    and the     Total number of positive decisions    issued during a reference period, for each ""stage in the procedure"" (first or final). Thus,     Total number of positive decisions    refers to the sum of decisions granting refugee status, subsidiary protection status, authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons (for countries where applicable) and temporary protection status. Whereas     Total number of decisions    refers to     Total number of positive decisions    plus rejected applicants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d`\x85\x1c\x14 \x00';

Core business functions    are activities of an enterprise yielding income: the production of final goods or services intended for the market or for third parties. Usually the core business functions make up the primary activity of the enterprise, but they may also include other (secondary) activities if the enterprise considers these as part of its core functions.    Support business functions    are ancillary (supporting) activities carried out by the enterprise in order to permit or to facilitate the core business functions, its production activity. The outputs (results) of support business functions are not themselves intended directly for the market or for third parties.    Support business functions can be further subdivided into:    distribution and logistics: transportation activities, warehousing and order processing;     marketing, sales and after-sales services: market research, advertising, direct marketing services (telemarketing), exhibitions, fairs and other marketing or sales services; also included are call-centre services and after-sales services such as help-desks and other customer support services;     information and communication technology (ICT) services: information technology (IT) services and telecommunication (IT services including hardware and software consultancy, customised software data processing and database services, maintenance and repair, web-hosting, as well as other computer-related and information services, but excluding packaged software and hardware);     administrative and management functions: legal services, accounting, book-keeping and auditing, business management and consultancy, human resources (HR) management (e.g. training and education, staff recruitment, provision of temporary personnel, payroll management as well as health and medical services), corporate financial and insurance services; also included are procurement functions.     engineering and related technical services: engineering and related technical consultancy, technical testing, analysis and certification; also included are design services;     research & development (R & D): research and experimental development.

1215;1852;   Organic farming    is a way of agricultural production which uses     organic production    methods and places the highest emphasis on environmental and wildlife protection and, with regard to livestock production, on animal welfare considerations. Organic production involves holistic production management systems for crops and livestock, emphasizing on-farm management practices over off-farm inputs.    This is accomplished by avoiding, or largely reducing, the use of synthetic chemicals such as     fertilisers    ,     pesticides    , (     fungicides    ,     herbicides    ,     insecticides    ), additives and veterinary medicinal products, replacing them, wherever possible, with cultural, biological and mechanical methods. Organic producers develop a healthy, fertile soil by growing and rotating a mixture of crops and using clover to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. The production of genetically-modified (GM) crops and their use in animal feed is avoided.    In the context of     European Union (EU)    statistics, farming is considered to be organic if it complies with     Regulation 834/2007    of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products.

1216;1854;"  The     Sullivan method    or     Sullivan's method    is a very simple method to compute     health expectancies    . It combines data issued from a regular period of life table on the one hand and from cross-sectional survey providing prevalence of given health dimension on the other hand, for instance disability. The age-specific prevalence is directly applied to the person-year of the life table: it provides the total number of years spent with disability, the total number of years lived without disability, and summing both, the total number of years lived.    The main advantage of the Sullivan's method lies in the separate collection of     mortality    and disability data and in the ready availability of the data necessary for the calculation. Basic cross-sectional surveys are sufficient to collect the observed prevalence of disability within the population. However the problem with this method lies in approximating the period prevalence by the observed prevalence of disability.    The concept of health expectancies as health indicators was proposed by Sanders (1964) and the first example was published in a report of the US Department of Health Education and Welfare (Sullivan, 1971). This report contained preliminary estimates of ""     disability-free life expectancy    "" calculated using a method devised by Sullivan and applicable to any state of health definition. The term Sullivan Health Expectancy should be used as shorthand for health expectancy calculated by the Sullivan method.    The Sullivan health expectancy reflects the current health of a real population adjusted for mortality levels and independent of age structure. Health expectancy calculated by Sullivan?s method is the number of remaining years, at a particular age, which an individual can expect to live in a healthy state (however health may be defined).

Mortality    is the number of deaths for a given area during a given period.     Infant mortality    is the mortality of live-born children aged less than one year.

Subsidies on products    is a sub-item within subsidies. Subsidies on products are subsidies payable per unit of a good or service produced or imported. The subsidy may be a specific amount of money per unit of quantity of a good or service, or it may be calculated ad valorem as a specified percentage of the price per unit. A subsidy may also be calculated as the difference between a specified target price and the market price actually paid by a buyer. A subsidy on a product usually becomes payable when the good is produced, sold or imported. Subsidies on products can only pertain to     market output    or to output for own final use.    Subsidies on products comprise import and export subsidies and other subsidies on products (e.g. subsidies on products used domestically and subsidies to public corporations to compensate for persistent losses which they incur as a result of charging prices below average costs of production).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8da\x03\xf8V \x00';

Metadata describe data by giving definitions of populations, objects, variables, the methodology and quality.    A distinction is generally made between structural and reference metadata.     Structural metadata     are used to identify, formally describe or retrieve statistical data, such as dimension names, variable names, dictionaries, dataset technical descriptions, dataset locations, keywords for finding data etc. For example, structural metadata refer to the titles of the variables and dimensions of statistical datasets, as well as the units employed, code lists (e.g. for territorial coding), data formats, potential value ranges, time dimensions, value ranges of flags, classifications used, etc.     Reference metadata     (sometimes called      explanatory metadata     ) describe the contents and the quality of the statistical data from a semantic point of view. They include explanatory texts on the context of the statistical data, methodologies for data collection and data aggregation as well as quality and dissemination characteristics. In      Eurostat     this information is presented in files based on a standardised format called ESMS (Euro SDMX Metadata Structure) This standard is based on previous standards (including the Standard Data Dissemination Standard developed by the      International Monetary Fund     ) but has been substantially extended in order to include more information on data quality.

In order to be relevant, they have to reflect current developments with the shortest possible delays.    STS indicators are important tools for formulating and monitoring economic and monetary policies. They are in great demand by policy makers (national and regional governments), the     European Commission    , central banks (particularly the     European Central Bank    ), private     enterprises    , professional organizations and financial markets.

In the past two statistical units were used, the KAU for construction and industry, the enterprise for trade and services. For a transition period the enterprise may be used by National Statistical Institutes for trade and industry indicators in short-term statitics.    The     kind-of-activity unit (KAU)    is a part of an enterprise (see below). The KAU groups together all the offices, production facilities etc. of an enterprise which contribute to the performance of a specific economic activity defined at class level (four digits) of the     European classification of economic activities (NACE Rev. 2.)    For example a kind-of-activity unit might be the combination of all parts of a metal producing enterprise that produce copper (class 24.44 in NACE Rev. 2); within the same enterprise there might be another KAU consisting of those parts that produce aluminium (class 24.42 in NACE Rev. 2). In order to statistically subdivide enterprises into KAUs the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus and employment and gross fixed capital formation.    The purpose of the KAU is to improve the homogeneity of statistical surveys by economic activity. In the above example, without the use of KAUs, it might be necessary to classify the enterprise either as a copper manufacturer or as an aluminium manufacturer. In such a way rather diverse enterprises might be considered to engage in the same economic activity which would make statistical results less clear and comparable.    An     enterprise    is an organisational unit producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than one location. An enterprise is not necessarily a sole legal unit but can be a group of legal units.

1228;1877;"  The     International patent classification    , abbreviated as     IPC    , was established by the     Strasbourg Agreement    of 1971. It creates a hierarchical system of language-independent symbols for the classification of patents and utility models according to the different technical fields to which they belong.    The classifiation system containts about 70 000 entries, i.e. classification symbols or codes that can be allotted to patent documents.    Symbols are arranged in a hierarchical, tree-like structure:    at the highest level are the eight      sections     corresponding to very broad technical fields (e.g., Section C deals with chemistry and metallurgy);     sections are further subdivided into      classes     (e.g., Class C21 deals with the metallurgy of iron);     classes are divided into more than 600      subclasses     (e.g., Subclass A21B contains bakers' ovens and machines or equipment for baking).

1230;1881;"  A     birth    is defined as the start of life when a child emerges from the body of its mother. The total number of births includes both live births and stillbirths.    A     live birth    is the birth of a child who showed any sign of life; the number of live births refers to the number of births excluding stillbirths.    A     stillbirth    is the expulsion or extraction from the mother of a dead foetus after the time at which it would normally be presumed capable of independent extra-uterine existence (outside the uterus or womb). This is commonly taken to be after 24 or 28 weeks of     gestation    (the time from a child's conception to its birth).    A     live birth outside marriage    is a live birth where the mother?s marital status at the time of birth is other than married.    The     crude birth rate    is the ratio of the number of births during the year to the average population in that year; the value is expressed per 1 000 inhabitants.

1232;1883;   Foreign direct investment    , abbreviated as     FDI    , is an international investment within the balance of payment accounts. Essentially, a resident entity in one economy seeks to obtain a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. A lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise, and an investor's significant influence on the management of the enterprise.    A direct investment enterprise is one in which a direct investor owns 10 % or more of the ordinary shares or votingrights (for an incorporated enterprise) or the equivalent (for an unincorporated enterprise).    FDI flows and positions: through direct investment flows, an investor builds up a FDI position that has an impact on an economy's international investment position. This FDI position (or FDI stock) differs from the accumulated flows because of revaluation (changes in prices or exchange rates), and other adjustments like rescheduling or cancellation of loans or debt-equity swaps.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa0\x8d\xd1, \x00';

A     third country national    is any person who is not a citizen of the European Union (EU), including stateless persons - see Art. 2.1 (i) of the     Council Regulation (EC) No 862/2007    .    A     stateless    person is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law, as set out in Article 1of the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons     [1]     .    A     recognised non-citizen    is a person who is not a citizen of the reporting country nor of any other country, but who has established links to that country which include some but not all rights and obligations of full citizenship.

1237;1891;"   Short sea shipping    , abbreviated as     SSS    , is the maritime transport of goods over relatively short distances, as opposed to the intercontinental cross-ocean     deep sea shipping    . In the context of     European Union (EU)    transport statistics it is defined as maritime transport of goods between     ports    in the EU (sometimes also including     candidate countries    and     EFTA    countries) on one hand, and ports situated in geographical Europe, on the Mediterranean and Black Seas on the other hand, i.e. ports in    EU maritime countries;     EEA     countries (Iceland and Norway);     candidate countries;     the Baltic Sea area (Russia);     the Mediterranean Sea area (Albania, Algeria, Bosnia?Herzegovina, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Occupied Palestinian territory, Syria, and Tunisia);     the Black Sea area (Georgia, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine).    This definition is derived from Commission Communication     COM (1999) 317 final    of June 1999 on the development of SSS in Europe (page 2). As a result, short sea shipping also includes     feeder services    : a short-sea network between ports with the objective of consolidating or redistributing freight to or from a     deep sea service    in one of these ports, the so-called     hub port    .

1239;1896;"  The     standardised death rate    , abbreviated as     SDR    , is the death rate of a population adjusted to a standard age distribution. It is calculated as a weighted average of the age-specific     death rates    of a given population; the weights are the age distribution of that population.    As most causes of death vary significantly with people?s age and sex, the use of standardised death rates improves comparability over time and between countries. The reason is that death rates can be measured independently of the age structure of populations in different times and countries (sex ratios usually are more stable).    Standardised death rates are calculated on the basis of the     'European Standard Population'    revised by Eurostat in 2012 (and published in 2013).    As method for standardisation, the direct method is applied. Standardised death rates are calculated for the age group 0-64 ('premature death'), 65 years and more, and for the total of all ages.

1240;1900;  The     services producer price index    , abbreviated as     SPPI    , is a     business-cycle    indicator which measures the gross change in the trading price of services including e.g. freight and passenger transport, postal services, accomodation and food services, information and communciation services, computer programming, consultancy services, legal and accounting services, architecture and engineering, advertising, office support, security services etc. In general the     NACE    sections , H, I, J, L, M, and N are covered by SPPIs. The only exceptions in these areas are veterinary services (M75), services of head offices (M70.1), and scientific research services (M72).    Public services are excluded, as for those services (for example health and education) the notion of price is not obvious and the ways they are provided are very different from country to country. Moreover, STS does not cover banking and insurance activities and thus also no prices for such services.    The     Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2020/1197    of 30 July 2020 implementing     Regulation (EU) No 2019/2152    of 27 November 2019 (European Business Statistics Regulation) introduced SPPIs for a large number of services industries that were not covered by the former STS Regulation.    Similar to the industrial     producer price index    , the SPPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the perspective of the seller. The SPPIs are used as an aspect of output for the seller and as a cost factor for the buyer    The SPPI covers services provided for all uses, i.e. for     intermediate    as well as for final consumption. However, the economic service activities for which the SPPI is calculated (see above) are mainly consumed by other businesses for the production of their own goods and services.     Inflation    experienced by consumers is measured by the     harmonised index of consumer prices    .    The SPPI is an important measure of inflation as services account for over half of modern economies. It is also employed to analyze the origins of inflation since it shows which services consumed by other businesses might be the sources of price increases.The SPPI is used as well as a     deflator    for services turnover (measured in current prices) and thus allows calculating a volume indicator for services similar to the     volume index of industrial production    .    The SPPI is calculated on a quarterly basis, EU data are available from 2006 on.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dc9\xd6\x82 \x00';

There can be different reasons for setting up a SPE:    to protect a company from financial risk, often in the context of a large project;     to separate different layers of equity infusion in complex financing operations;     to own and more easily dispose of assets and associated permits and rights;     to engage in a public-private partnership relying on a project-finance structure.    As there is no universally accepted definition of a special-purpose entity yet, not all of the above-mentioned characteristics or reasons have to be applied to be called such.    A     multinational enterprise (MNE)    often diversifies its investments geographically through a SPE; examples are financing subsidiaries, conduits, holding companies, shell companies, shelf companies and brass-plate companies.

Lorry    is a rigid road motor vehicle designed, exclusively or primarily, to carry goods.    Road tractor    is designed, exclusively or primarily, to haul other road vehicles which are not power-driven (mainly semi-trailers). Agricultural tractors are excluded.    Trailer    is designed to be hauled by a road motor vehicle. This category excludes agricultural trailers and caravans.

1246;1913;   Soil cover    refers to vegetation, including crops, and crop residues on the surface of the soil.    The various farming practices can be used in order to reduce soil degradation. Maintaining the cover of the soil during winter is one of such practices that reduce soil erosion and the loss of particulate pollutants (i.e. those attached to soil) including nutrients, plant protection products and faecal microbes. This practice also increases soil organic matter. Agricultural land with no plant cover or where there are just plant residues on the top is especially vulnerable to nutrient leakage.    In some     EU Member States    requirements to either have normal winter crops like winter wheat or cover crops are included in legislation or are part of the agri-environmental schemes farmers can adhere to. These crops should not be mistaken for normal winter green crops, such as winter wheat which is to be harvested or grassland. These are crops sown in the autumn with the sole aim to reduce nutrient leakage. Normally they are ploughed in during spring before sowing another crop, and are not harvested or used for grazing.    The following categories are defined under soil cover:     arable land covered with normal winter crop     - an area of      arable land     on which crops are sown in the autumn and growing during the winter (normal winter crops, such as winter wheat), normally harvested or used for grazing     arable land covered with cover crop or intermediate crop     - an area of arable land on which plants are sown specifically to reduce the loss of soil, nutrients and plant protection products during the winter or other periods when the land would otherwise be bare and susceptible to losses. The economic interest of these crops is low, and the main goal is soil and nutrient protection. Normally they are ploughed in during spring before sowing another crop, and are not harvested or used for grazing. Agricultural land with no plant cover or where there are just plant residues on the top is especially vulnerable to soil erosion and nutrient and pesticide loss. In efforts to reduce losses which are harmful both to the environment and to the economy one of the most efficient tools is keeping the land covered with plants at all times. These crops should not be mistaken for normal winter crops or grassland.     arable land covered with plant residues     - an area of arable land covered with the plant residues and stubble of the previous crop season during winter, intermediate and cover crops]are excluded. Plants residues can be straw, stubble or other plants parts leaving good mulch (for example sugar beet leaves) regardless if they remain from the previous harvest or have been added by the farmer. Potatoes are normally excluded because the stalks are degraded too quickly. The      tillage     operations are in this case normally carried out in the spring. Certain tillage operations can be carried out on in autumn, if they leave enough plant residues on the surface. Such tillage methods could be chisel or disk ploughing or similar. The straw can be removed for energy or other purposes, but an indicative threshold for remaining residue is minimum 10%. Self-grown cereals cover the soil following a tillage operation is included     arable land with bare soil     - an area of arable land that is ploughed or otherwise tilled in autumn and is not sown or covered during winter with any plant residues, remaining bare until the pre-seeding or seeding agro-technical operations in the following spring period. Arable land on which      tillage     methods leave more than 10% of plant residues on the surface are recorded under ?plant residues?

This definition calls for further clarification:    (i)Social protection schemes should at all times meet the condition that it must be possible to draw up a separate account of     receipts    and     expenditures    .    (ii)Preferably, social protection schemes are chosen in such a way that they provide protection against a single risk or need and cover a single specific group of beneficiaries.    An example of a social protection scheme is the National Family Allowances Fund - Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales (CNAF) in France.

ESSPROS is built on the concept of social protection, or the coverage of precisely defined risks and needs including health, disability, old age, family and     unemployment    ; it records the receipts and the expenditure of the organizations or schemes involved in social protection interventions.    ESSPROS is composed of the     core system    and of     modules    . The core system contains two types of annual data (collected by Eurostat from 1990 on):     quantitative data     : social protection receipts and expenditures by schemes (a distinct body of rules, supported by one or more institutional units, governing the provision of social protection benefits and their financing);     qualitative data     : metadata by scheme and detailed benefit.    Social protection benefits are transfers to households, in cash or in kind, intended to relieve them from the financial burden of a number of risks or needs. The risks or needs of social protection included in ESSPROS are disability, sickness/healthcare, old age, survivors, family/children, unemployment, housing and social exclusion not elsewhere classified.    The modules contain supplementary statistical information on particular aspects of social protection: they relate to pensions' beneficiaries and to net social benefits.    Under ESSPROS, the     expenditure    of social protection is classified by type, indicating the nature of, or the reason for, the expenditure:     social protection benefits     ;     administration costs;     transfers to other schemes;     other expenditure.    Social benefits can be further broken down by type or by function:     type     refers to the form in which benefits are provided, for example in cash or in kind;     social protection      functions     refer to the needs covered by benefits: thus, income maintenance can be paid in with regard to health, but also disability, old age, maternity or unemployment.    Receipts of social protection schemes are classified by type or by origin:    the      type     gives the nature of, or the reason for a payment:      social contributions     , general government contributions, transfers from other schemes and other receipts;     the      origin     specifies the      institutional sector     from which the payment is received:      all        resident institutional units       :        corporations;         general government         ;         household sector         ;         non-profit institutions serving households         ;        rest of the world.

1255;1927;   Social protection receipts    are the revenue (income) that is received for the funding of schemes for     social protection    (also called social safety net or social security) to combat poverty and inequality. These include     social contributions    , general government contributions, and other receipts.    Employers? social contributions are the costs that employers have to pay to secure the rights to social benefits for their employees, former employees and their dependents. They may be actual or imputed (given a value), and all employers (resident or non-resident) can pay them.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dd\x931\x93 \x00';

1257;1931;  The     European system of national and regional accounts    , abbreviated as     ESA95    or sometimes     1995 ESA    , collected comparable, up-to-date and reliable information on the structure and developments of the economy of the Member States of the     European Union    and their respective regions. By providing an internationally compatible accounting framework, ESA95 made it possible to describe the total economy of a region, country or group of countries, its components and its relation to other total economies.    The ESA95 prescribed the structure and layout of supply and use tables, symmetric input-output tables and tables linking supply and use tables to the sector accounts. These requirements refer to definitions of transactions and to concepts of classification and valuation.    ESA95 is broadly consistent with the System of National Accounts of the United Nations (1993 SNA) with regards to definitions, accounting rules and classifications. But due to greater accuracy requirements for definitions and the accounting rules, it also has some specificities, particularly in its presentation, which is more in line with EU practices.    Since September 2014, ESA95 has been replaced by ESA 2010.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dd\xf013 \x00';
1258;1934;   Smoothing    refers to     estimating    a smooth     trend    , usually by means of     weighted averages    of     observations    . The term smooth is used because such averages tend to reduce randomness by allowing positive and negative random effects to partially offset each other.  ;0;0;"b'\x0bBN\x8de""\x8f/ \x00'";
1259;1935;   Exponential smoothing methods    provide     forecasts    using weighted averages of past values of     data    and forecast errors. They are commonly used in inventory control systems where many items are to be forecasted and low cost is a primary concern. The simplest exponential smoothing method refers to single exponential smoothing (SES), which is suitable for data with no clear trends or seasonal patterns.    For data characterised by trends, Holt?s method is suitable, while for seasonal data, Holt-Winters? method may be used. Both of these methods require some starting values to feed the algorithm, values which can be obtained by means of     backcasting    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa5\xb6\xfd\xf4 \x00';

1263;1939;  The     Single euro payments area    , abbreviated as     SEPA    , is a self-regulatory initiative by the banking sector of Europe (represented in the European Payments Council ? EPC) aiming to harmonise payment products, infrastructures and technical standards for the     euro    across the     euro area    in such a way that all electronic payments across borders become as easy as domestic payments. It applies to payments by citizens, companies and other economic actors made via credit card, debit card, bank transfer or direct debit.    The     European Commission     Directive 2366/2015/EU    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market (amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC) provides the necessary legal framework for SEPA, by regulating payment services and payment service providers throughout the     European Union (EU)    and     European Economic Area (EEA)    , with the objectives of both increasing competition and participation in the payments industry (also from non-banks) and providing for a level playing field by harmonising consumer protection and the rights/obligations for payment providers and users.    Implementation of SEPA in the Member States of the EU as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland has occurred on a step-by-step basis, the latest step being the launch of the 'SEPA direct debit capability' on 13 October 2009. To ensure that SEPA is fully implemented, the     European Commission    published a SEPA Roadmap for 2009-2012 identifying actions with clear deadlines under six priority areas. To date there has been no agreement on an end date for final implementation among the various stakeholders. SEPA includes territories considered to be part of the EU in accordance with Article 299 of the     Treaty of Rome    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8de\xa7 \xef \x00';
1264;1943;  Data on     slaughtering and meat production    are collected on a monthly basis. They refer to the activity of     slaughterhouses    , while the share of domestic slaughtering (i.e. outside officially recognized slaughterhouses) is now explicitly being left out of the figures in order to improve comparability of the results across Member States, with a break in the time series however. The slaughtering meat production combined with the balance of external trade for live animals make an estimation of the     gross indigenous production    possible.    The legal basis of the data collection on slaughering and meat production is, like for the     Livestock survey    ,     Regulation 1165/2008    of 19 November 2008 concerning livestock and meat statistics.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8de\xbd5\xbf \x00';

Its overall objective is to simplify     Intrastat    , the intra-EU trade data collection system, on the basis of the principle that data already collected and available within the     European statistical system (ESS)    should not be collected more than once. Accordingly, each intra-EU transaction reported in one Member State may serve as a data source for     two    Member States, both for compiling the intra-EU exports of the exporting Member State and for verifying and/or compiling the intra-EU imports of the receiving Member State.

1275;1962;"  The     EU statistics on income and living conditions    , abbreviated as     EU-SILC    , is the reference source for comparative statistics on income distribution and social inclusion in the     European Union (EU)    . It is used for policy monitoring within the '     Open method of coordination (OMC)    '.    EU-SILC was launched in 2003 on the basis of a gentlemen's agreement between     Eurostat    and six Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg) and Norway. It was formally launched in 2004 in fifteen countries and expanded in 2005 to cover all of the then     EU-25    Member States, together with Norway and Iceland. Bulgaria launched EU-SILC in 2006 while Romania, Switzerland and Turkey introduced the survey in 2007. EU-SILC provides two types of annual data:    cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions;     longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period.    EU-SILC is a multi-purpose instrument which focuses mainly on income. Detailed data are collected on income components, mostly on personal income, although a few     household    income components are included. However, information on social exclusion, housing conditions, labour, education and health information is also obtained.    EU-SILC is based on the idea of a common ?framework? and no longer a common ?survey?. The common framework defines    the harmonised lists of target primary (annual) and secondary (every four years or less frequently) variables to be transmitted to Eurostat;     common guidelines and procedures;     common concepts (household and income) and classifications aimed at maximising comparability of the information produced.    The reference population in EU-SILC includes all     private households    and their current members residing in the territory of the countries at the time of data collection. Persons living in     collective households    and in institutions are generally excluded from the target population. Some small parts of the national territory amounting to no more than 2 % of the national population and the national territories may be excluded from EU-SILC. All household members are surveyed, but only those aged 16 and more are interviewed.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8df\xade\xbb \x00';
1276;1963;  The     System of health accounts    , abbreviated as     SHA    , provides an economic framework for health accounting in the     European Union (EU)    Member States, using accounting rules methodologically compatible with the     System of national accounts    .    The SHA provides a standard framework for producing a set of comprehensive, consistent and internationally comparable accounts to meet the needs of public and private sector health analysts and policy-makers. At present, national health accounts are at different stages of development and may not only differ in the boundaries drawn between health and other social and economic activities but also in the classifications used, the level of detail provided, and in the accounting rules. The SHA provides a framework for a family of interrelated tables for standard reporting for expenditure (spending) on health and for its financing. It has been written with the dual aim of providing this framework for international data collections and as a possible model for redesigning and complementing national health accounts to aid policy-makers.    The demand for improved health accounts is driven by an increasing complexity of healthcare systems in many countries and the rapid evolution in medical technology. Policy-makers and observers of healthcare systems and recent reforms have questioned the adequacy of accounting practices and the ability of health accounts to monitor fast-changing healthcare systems that are becoming increasingly complex. Raising consumers? expectations of healthcare contributes to the demand for up-to-date information on healthcare systems.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8df\xbd\x80\xf6 \x00';
1277;1964;  The     standard gross margin    , abbreviated as     SGM    , is a measure of the production or the business size of an     agricultural holding    . It is based on the separate activities or 'enterprises' of a farm and their relative contribution to overall revenue.For each separate activity (for instance wheat,     dairy cows    or a vineyard), a SGM is estimated, based on the area (for     crop output    ) or the number of heads (for     animal output    ) and a standardised SGM coefficient for each type of crop and livestock, calculated separately for different geographical areas to allow for differences in profit. The sum of all these margins per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall economic size, expressed in     European size units    or ESU - 1 ESU is a 1200 euro SGM.    SGMs represent the level of profit to be expected on the average farm under 'normal' conditions (discounting, for example, disease outbreaks, fires and floods, adverse weather). The standard gross margin (SGM) for a farm is the difference between the gross production (to which subsidies are added) and the variable specific costs.    The definition and principles for calculating SGM coefficients can be found in Annex I to     Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985    , listing also the types of farming or the farm structure characteristics to be used. On a farm, the share of each separate activity in the total SGM of a farm enables to classify the farm in one of the types of farming defined by the legislation. For instance, if the share of olive trees in the total SGM is over 2/3, the farm is taken as specialist olives.    Since 1985, the typology of the agricultural holdings was based on SGMs calculated taking into account the gross output and the subsidies, as well as certain deductible specific costs. In the meantime the common agricultural policy has drasticallychanged and the majority of the direct payments has been decoupled. Due to this decoupling of direct payments since 2005, it was not possible to maintain the previous typology (Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985) based on SGM. A SGM without subsidies could be negative and therefore can not be used as classification criteria. Therefore, a new typology has been established.    From FSS 2010 onward the SGM has been replaced by     standard output    (abbreviated as SO) according to the     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014    of 1 August 2014 supplementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Union) repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008).

1278;1965;  The     Stability and growth pact    , abbreviated as     SGP    , is a rule-based framework for the coordination of national fiscal policies under     economic and monetary union (EMU)    and the creation of the     euro area    with its single currency, the     euro    . It was established to safeguard sound public finances, an important requirement for EMU to function properly. The SGP consists of a preventive and a dissuasive arm.    The SGP has to be seen against the background of Stage III of economic and monetary union, which began on 1 January 1999. Its aim is to ensure that the Member States continue their budgetary discipline efforts once the euro has been introduced.    The pact stems from a     European Council    resolution (adopted at Amsterdam on 17 June 1997) and two Council regulations of 7 July 1997 laying down detailed technical arrangements, one on the surveillance of budgetary positions and coordination of economic policies and the other on implementing the     Excessive deficit procedure    .    In the medium term, the euro-area Member States undertake to achieve a balanced or nearly balanced budget and to give the Council and the     European Commission    a stability programme every year. Along the same lines, Member States outside the euro area are required to submit a     convergence programme    .    The Stability and growth pact opens the way for the Council to penalise any euro area Member State that fails to take appropriate measures to end an excessive     deficit    . Initially, thepenalty takes the form of a non-interest bearing deposit with the EU, but it could be converted into a fine if the excessive deficit is not corrected within two years.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8df\xdb2J \x00';

1285;1977;  The     Structure of earnings survey    , abbreviated as     SES    , is conducted every four years in the Member States of the     European Union (EU)    and provides comparable information at EU level on relationships between the level of     earnings    , individual characteristics of     employees    (sex, age, occupation, length of service,     educational level    ) and their employer (economic activity, size of the enterprise, etc.) for reference years 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 (next survey with reference year 2018).    The data collection is based on legislation and data become available approximately 2 years after the end of the reference period. In the SES     gross annual earnings    cover remuneration in cash and in kind paid during the reference year before any tax deductions and social-security contributions payable by wage earners and retained by the employer. The main difference between annual and monthly earnings in the SES is that annual earnings are not only the sum of the direct remuneration, bonuses and allowances paid to an employee in each pay period. Annual earnings hence usually exceed the figure produced by multiplying the ?standard monthly package? by 12. The ?standard monthly package? includes those bonuses and allowances which occur in every pay period, even if the amount for these ?regular? bonuses and allowances varies, but excludes bonuses and allowances not occurring in every pay period. Furthermore, monthly earnings leave payments in kind out of consideration. However, annual earnings also cover all ?non-standard payments?, i.e. payments not occurring in each pay period, and payments in kind.    The SES covers businesses with at least 10 employees and all economic activities defined in sections B to N, and P to S, of the     Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Communities      (     NACE Rev 2)    . The transmission of data covering     small enterprises    (below 10 employees) and enterprises belonging to NACE Rev. 2 section O is optional.    The SES represents a rich microdata source for European policy-making and research purposes.

A     nominal effective exchange rate    is the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-à-vis (as compared with) other currencies weighted by their share in either the country?s international trade or payments.    Real effective exchange rates    take account of price level differences between trading partners. Movements in real effective exchange rates give an indication of the evolution of a country?s aggregate (total) external price competitiveness.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dh\x8di\x8e \x00';

This is the market where shares and bonds are bought and sold between the time they were issued at first and before they mature (their end date). Many shares and bonds are sold and bought several times by different investors before they mature. The existence of a liquid (easy to be turned into cash) secondary market can encourage people to buy new issues in the primary market, as it means that it is much more likely that they will be able to sell them easily if they want to.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dh\xf8\x18s \x00';

As most causes of death vary significantly with people?s age and sex, the use of standardised death rates improves comparability over time and between countries. The reason is that death rates can be measured independently of the age structure of populations in different times and countries (sex ratios usually are more stable).

Buildings do not necessarily need walls. It is sufficient for them to have a roof, but there must be a demarcation which constitutes the individual character of the building to be used separately.    A separate building is any free-standing building; also, in the case of interconnected structures (e.g. semi-detached or terraced houses), any unit separated from other units by a fire wall extending from roof to cellar is considered an individual building. If there is no fire wall the interconnected building units are regarded as individual buildings if they have their own access (own entrance) as well as their own utility system and are separately usable.    For technical reasons, buildings also include separately usable underground constructions which can be entered by persons and are suitable or intended for protecting persons, animals or objects (e.g. underground shelters, underground hospitals, underground shopping centers and workshops, underground garages).    Buildings are subdivided into residential and non-residential buildings.A     residential building    is a building at least half of which is used for residential purposes. If less than half of the overall useful floor area is used for residential purposes, the building is classified under non-residential buildings in accordance with its purpose-oriented design.    A     non-residential building    is a building which is mainly used or intended for non-residential purposes.

In the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) remittances are perceived as a cumulative measure building upon three aggregation levels:     Personal remittances     cover the transfer of household funds in cash or kind and household assets to a non-resident household, usually situated in the migrant?s home economy (including donations to family, etc.), but also the net income being generated through employment in other economies, either as seasonal or border worker, or as resident with non-resident entities (e.g. international institutions domiciled in the resident?s home economy).     Total remittances     additionally include social benefits, which were acquired by the above mentioned economic activities of households in other economies, e.g. pension rights.     Total remittances and transfers to       non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH)      additionally include current and capital transfers of NPISH, such as donations in cash and kind, cross-border sponsorships, development aid programmes launched by public or private non-profit organisations (NGOs) in other countries.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dm\x15\xb2\xe3 \x00';

In all     European Union (EU)    and other European countries, contracting a     civil marriage    (before official authorities and on a legal basis) is possible. However, the relation between a civil marriage and a     religious marriage    (before religious representative only) is not the same in all countries. In 15 countries (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden as well as Norway and the United Kingdom) a religious marriage has consequences for the civil marriage in the sense that a religious marriage is recognised by the state as being equivalent to a civil marriage. France states that a religious marriage has no consequences for marital status, unless it has been contracted abroad.

Asylum decisions can be distinguished according to the     stage in the procedure    when they are taken:     First instance decision     means a decision granted by the respective authority acting as a first instance of the administrative/judicial asylum procedure in the receiving country.     Final decision     means a decision on whether the third-country national or stateless person be granted refugee or subsidiary protection status by virtue of      Directive 2011/95/EU     and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive, irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the Member States concerned pending its outcome. The asylum procedures and the numbers/levels of decision making bodies differ between Member States. The true 'final instance' may be, according to the national legislation and administrative procedures, a decision of the highest national court. However, it is not intended that these statistics should cover rare or exceptional cases determined by the highest courts. Thus, the statistics related to the 'final decisions' should refer to decisions against which there is no further possibility to appeal on the substance of the decision but only on procedural grounds.

1356;2085;   Research and development (R & D) intensity    for a country is defined as the     R & D expenditure    as a percentage of     gross domestic product    (GDP).    For an enterprise, R & D intensity is the ratio of a firm's R & D investment to its revenue (the percentage of revenue that is reinvested in R & D). R & D is the main driver of     innovation    , and R & D expenditure and intensity are two of the key indicators used to monitor resources devoted to science and technology worldwide. Governments are increasingly referring to international benchmarks when defining their science polices and allocating resources.    The     European Union (EU)    is currently lagging behind both the USA and Japan in terms of expenditure on R & D as a proportion of GDP, primarily due to slow relative growth in business R & D expenditure. The     European Council    set an overall target of 3 % of GDP by the year 2010, with industry asked to contribute two thirds of this objective.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dn\xc4\x86\x07 \x00';

Three approaches are used in the domain to identify technology-intensity: sectoral, product and patent approach.    The     sectoral approach    is a particular aggregation of the manufacturing industries according to the level of their technological intensity (     R&D    expenditure/value added), using the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (     NACE    Rev.2) at the 2- or 3-digit level for compiling groups. Manufacturing activities are grouped to 'high-technology', 'medium high-technology', 'medium low-technology' and 'low-technology'. Services activities, on the other hand, are mainly grouped together into 'knowledge-intensive services (KIS)' and 'less knowledge-intensive services (LKIS)' and these groups are defined according to a similar logic at the NACE Rev.2 2-digit level.     [1]     The     product approach    looks at the level of technological intensity of products of manufacturing industries and similarly identifies the trade in high-tech products. The high-tech product list is based on the calculations of R&D intensity by product groups (R&D expenditure/total sales). The groups classified as high-tech products are grouped together on the basis of the     Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)    .     [2]     The     patent approach    looks at whether or not a     patent    is high-tech and also defines     biotechnology    patents. The groups are put together on the basis of the     International Patent Classification (IPC)    , 8th edition, as are biotechnology patents.

1378;2116;"   Universities    usually draw on three types of funds to finance their     research and development (R & D)    activities:    R & D contracts and earmarked grants received from      government     and other      outside sources     . These should be credited to their original source.     Income from endowments, shareholdings, and property, plus receipts from the sale of non-R & D services such as fees from individual students, subscriptions to journals, and sales of serum or agricultural produce. These retained receipts are clearly the universities' ""      own funds     "". In the case of private universities, these may be a major source of funds for R & D.     The      general grant     they receive from the Ministry of Education or from the corresponding provincial or local authorities in support of their overall research/teaching activities.    This case gives rise to a conflict between the principle of tracing the original source and that of using the performer's report and also to some disagreement about how the criterion concerning the intentions of the funder should be applied.    In the      first approach     one argues that, as government is the original source and has intended at least part of the funds concerned to be devoted to R & D, the R & D content of these      public general university funds (GUF)     should be credited to government as a source of funds.     Using the      second approach     , one argues that it is within universities that the decisions are taken to commit money to R & D out of a pool which contains both ""own funds"" as narrowly defined in n°2 and public general university funds; therefore, the sums concerned should be credited to      higher education     as a source of funds.    While no recommendation can be made for national practice, government-financed GUF should be credited to the public sector as a source of funds for the purposes of international comparisons. For clarity, publicly financed     gross domestic expenditure on R & D (GERD)    is divided into two sub-categories:    direct government funds;     public general university funds (GUF).    The following procedures should be adopted:    GUF should be separately reported and any adjustments to the R & D costs series should take account of real or imputed social security and pensions provisions, which should be credited to GUF as a source of funds;     monies from the higher education ""block grant"" should be classified as GUF, and other monies generated by the sector should be considered as ""own funds"";     adjustments related to ""other current costs"" to account for real or imputed payments of rents etc., should be debited to direct government funds.

After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively.    The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the     institutional sectors    and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dq\x81\x84\xcd \x00';
1386;2124;  A     product innovation    is the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics.    Product innovations can utilise new knowledge or technologies, or can be based on new uses or combinations of existing knowledge or technologies. The term 'product' is used to cover both goods and services. Product innovations include both the introduction of new goods and services and significant improvements in the functional or user characteristics of existing goods and services.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dq\xb3\xdcd \x00';
1387;2125;  A     marketing innovation    is the implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing.    Marketing innovations are aimed at better addressing customer needs, opening up new markets, or newly positioning a firm's product on the market, with the objective of increasing the firm's sales.    The distinguishing feature of a marketing innovation compared to other changes in a firm's marketing instruments is the implementation of a marketing method not previously used by the firm. It must be part of a new marketing concept or strategy that represents a significant departure from the firm's existing marketing methods. The new marketing method can either be developed by the innovating firm or adopted from other firms or organisations. New marketing methods can be implemented for both new and existing products.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x84\x9dFQ \x00';
1388;2126;  An     organisational innovation    is the implementation of a new organisational method in the firm's business practices, workplace organisation or external relations.    Organisational innovations can be intended to increase a firm's performance by reducing administrative costs or transaction costs, improving workplace satisfaction (and thus labour productivity), gaining access to nontradable assets (such as non-codified external knowledge) or reducing costs of supplies.    The distinguishing features of an organisational innovation compared to other organisational changes in a firm is the implementation of an organisational method (in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations) that has not been used before in the firm and is the result of strategic decisions taken by management.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dy\x07\x98\x8d \x00';
1389;2127;  A     process innovation    is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software.    Process innovations can be intended to decrease unit costs of production or delivery, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver new or significantly improved products.    Process innovations include new or significantly improved methods for the creation and provision of services. They can involve significant changes in the equipment and software used in services-oriented firms or in the procedures or techniques that are employed to deliver services. Examples are the introduction of GPS tracking devices for transport services, the implementation of a new reservation system in a travel agency, and the development of new techniques for managing projects in a consultancy firm.    Process innovations also cover new or significantly improved techniques, equipment and software in ancillary support activities, such as purchasing, accounting, computing and maintenance. The implementation of new or significantly improved information and communication technology (ICT) is a process innovation if it is intended to improve the efficiency and/or quality of an ancillary support activity.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dre\x8f\x89 \x00';
1390;2128;"  The     production index    is a     business cycle    indicator which aims to measure changes in     value added at factor cost    of industry and construction over a given     reference period    . It does this by measuring changes in the volume of output and activity at close and regular intervals, usually monthly. European short-term statistics provide production indicators for industry and for construction. At the European level, a similar indicator is also published for services.    In order to calculate a genuine value added indicator data would be needed for an industry's gross output as well as for the inputs used in the production of these outputs. Such data are generally not available on a monthly (or quarterly) basis. In practice, suitable proxy values for the calculation of the production index are needed.    The production index should also take into account:    changes in type and quality of the commodities and of the input materials;     changes in stocks of finished goods and services, and work in progress;     changes in technical input-output relations (processing techniques);     services, such as assembly of production units, repairs or planning.    Within industry, these may include:    gross production values (      deflated     );     production volumes (physical quantities data);     turnover     (deflated);     work input;     raw material input;     energy input.    Within construction they may consist of:    input data (consumption of typical raw materials, energy or labour);     output data (production quantities, deflated production values, or deflated sales values).    In construction, separate production indices for     building    construction and     civil engineering    are calculated, according to the     Classification of types of construction (CC)    .

1400;2148;  The     price level index    , abbreviated as     PLI    , expresses the price level of a given country relative to another (or relative to a group of countries like the European Union), by dividing the     Purchasing power parities (PPPs)    by the current nominal     exchange rate    .    If the price level index of a country is higher than 100, the country concerned is relatively expensive compared to the one to which it is compared (for example the EU), while if the price level index is lower than 100, then the country is relatively inexpensive compared to the other country.    Price level indices are not intended to rank countries strictly. In fact, they only provide an indication of the order of magnitude of the price level in one country in relation to others, particularly when countries are clustered around a very narrow range of outcomes. The degree of uncertainty associated with the basic price data and the methods used for compiling PPPs, may affect in such a case the minor differences between the PLIs and result in differences in ranking which are not statistically or economically significant.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8ds[\x07\xf9 \x00';

It is defined as a fixed-weight, or fixed-basket, index that uses the basket of goods and services and their weights from the base period. It is also known as a ?base-weighted index?.    In price statistics other price index formulas may be used (     Paasche price index    ,     Fisher price index    ). The choice of the index formula, however, often depends on the availability of data.

Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion, when calculations are based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day zero and not day one; days 0-6 therefore correspond to ?completed week zero?; days 7-13 to ?completed week one?; and the 40th week of actual gestation is synonymous with ?completed week 39?.    Where the date of the last normal menstrual period is not available, gestational age should be based on the best clinical estimate.

Purchasing power parities are obtained by comparing price levels for a basket of comparable goods and services that are selected to be representative of consumption patterns in the various countries.    PPPs make it possible to produce meaningful indicators (based on either price or volume) required for cross-country comparisons, truly reflecting the differences in the purchasing power of, for example,     households    . Monetary exchange rates cannot be used to compare the volumes of income or expenditure because they usually reflect more elements than just price differences, for example, volumes of financial transactions between currencies and expectations in the foreign exchange markets.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8du\x0e\x1d\xb1 \x00';
1425;2175;"  The (industrial)     producer price index    , abbreviated as     PPI    and also called     output price index    , is a     business-cycle    indicator showing the development of transaction prices for the monthly industrial output of economic activities.    The PPI does not only serve as an early indicator of     inflationary    pressures in the economy before it reaches the consumer, but it can also record the evolution of prices over longer time periods.    The PPI for a specific     economic activity    measures the monthly change in the trading price of products and related services. The PPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the seller's perspective. The prices collected in period     t    should refer to orders booked during period     t    (at the moment of the order) and not the moment when the commodities leave the factory gates. Price indices are calculated as a     weighted    average of the relevant products.    PPIs are calculated for the total, the     domestic    and the     non-domestic    markets, with the latter further split between     euro area     and     non-euro area    markets. The indicators of domestic and non-domestic prices require separate producer price indices to be compiled according to the destination of the product. The residency of the third party which has ordered or bought the product defines the destination. The domestic market is defined as all third parties ordering or buying which are residents in the same national territory as the     observation unit    from which sales or orders are collected. When combined, the sub-indices for the domestic and the non-domestic markets give the total change in the PPI for a given product.    The appropriate price for calculating the PPI is the basic price that excludes     VAT    and similar deductible taxes which are directly linked to     turnover    , as well as all duties and taxes on the goods and services invoiced. However, subsidies on products received by the producer, if there are any, should be added to the basic price.    All price-determining characteristics should be taken into account, including the:    quantity of units sold;     transport provided;     rebates;     service conditions;     guarantee conditions;     destination.

1426;2176;"   Poultry housing    can be divided into:     battery cages      straw beds      aviaries      free range     Battery cages    are     animal housing    systems where the laying hens are kept in cages, one or more in each, inside closed buildings with forced ventilation and with or without a lighting system. Birds are kept in tiered cages, usually made of steel wire, arranged in long rows. Droppings fall through the bottom of the cages and are collected and stored underneath in a deep pit or channel or are removed by a belt or scraper system. The droppings from laying hens in battery systems are not mixed with other material such as litter and may be dried or have water added to make the     manure    easier to manage. There are three common battery systems for laying hens in use in Europe:     with manure belt     : battery cages where the manure is removed mechanically by a belt below the cages to outside the building to form solid dung/farmyard manure. Movable belts, e.g. made of ?non ?stick? polypropylene, below the cages on which droppings are collected and are transported outside the house to a closed storage. In improved systems, there is provision to dry the manure on the belts by forced air through perforated pipes or drying tunnels over the cages. Battery cages with manure removal by scrapers are also included here;     with deep pit     : battery cages where the manure falls into a deep pit beneath cages where it forms slurry. The birds are housed in cages in one or more tiers. Droppings fall into a manure pit (deep pit) or a channel beneath the cages by themselves or with the aid of a scraper together with spilled water from the drinkers. The layer of manure is removed once a year or less frequently by scraper or front loader on a tractor. In some systems, the ventilation system for the house is designed so that warm air is used to dry the wet manure in the deep pit or a channel;     with stilt house     : battery cages where the manure falls on the floor below the cages where it forms solid dung/farmyard manure and is mechanically removed regularly. This is similar to a deep pit house except that there is a variable valve between the cage and dropping storage areas and large openings in the dropping store walls that allow wind to pass through and assist drying. Cage and dropping areas of the building are separated so droppings can be removed at any convenient time without disturbing the birds.     Laying hen housing on straw-beds    (deep litter-loose housing) are     animal houses    where the floor is covered with a thick layer of litter (straw, peat, sawdust, or other similar material binding the manure) that is removed only at intervals that may be several months apart. A simple closed building that is thermally insulated and with forced ventilation or natural ventilation. At least a third of the floor area must be covered with bedding (e.g. chopped straw, wood shavings) and two thirds arranged as a pit covered with slats to collect droppings (waste voided by poultry) over the 13 ? 15 month egg laying period. Laying nests, feeders and water supply are placed over the slatted area to keep the litter dry. Corresponds to management systems of poultry manure with litter (IPCC, 2006).    Aviary housing    (also called multi-level systems or percheries) consists of a ground floor plus one or more levels of perforated platforms, from which manure cannot fall on birds below. At some point across the system there will be at least two levels available for birds. An aviary house is a construction with thermal insulation, forced ventilation and either natural or artificial light. They can be combined with free range and outside scratching area. Birds are kept in large groups and are free to move over the entire house area over multiple levels. The space is subdivided into different areas: feeding and drinking, sleeping and resting, scratching, egg laying. Because animals can use several levels, higher stock densities are allowed in comparison to the deep litter regime. Droppings are removed by manure belts or collected in a manure pit. Corresponds to management systems of poultry manure without litter (IPCC, 2006). For the purposes of IFS, aviaries with deep little should be classified as deep litter housing. Aviaries where the animals have access to outdoor areas can be classified as free range.    Free ranges    (outdoors) can be covered with grass. The birds have access to this area from houses via popholes in the wall and from the covered veranda, if present. They will use the area if they feel there is sufficient shelter. The shelter may be trees or bushes, but it can also be artificial shelter (elevated nets, tents, mobile hen houses). Also, a fence can be used as cover to walk along. Providing a sand bath is another way to attract poultry to use these facilities. Areas near the house may be covered with free-draining material, in order to maintain good hygiene both outside and inside the house.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8duJ\xb6\xd9 \x00';

The term refers to any kind of domesticated bird, or captive bird which is raised for meat, eggs or feathers. Domestic ostriches are kept as poultry, in line with this definition, but are not considered gamefowl nor waterfowl (as they are of the order     Struthioniformes    ).    The CAP refers to ""farmyard poultry"" to identify poultry raised in the farms, i.e. with an economic purpose.    Includes     Domestic hens and chickens (      Gallus gallus     L.)

FADN    FADN does not make any further distinction of pullets so the FADN code includes both pullets that have been stalled as adults and those that have not yet been stalled as adults. The distinction between the stalled or not yet stalled pullets is less important for FADN than for IFS. FADN gets the information on animal numbers from the whole year?s period. The farm return questionnaire asks for an average number of animals where animals are counted in proportion to the length of time they have been on the holding during the accounting year, so any temporary, short-lived situation is minimised in the resulting number and there is no need for a special treatment of pullets not yet stalled.

1429;2179;"   Gestational age    is the duration of gestation (being with child) measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Gestational age is expressed in completed days or completed weeks (e.g. events occurring 280 to 286 completed days after the onset of the last normal menstrual period are considered to have occurred at 40 weeks of gestation).    Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion, when calculations are based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day zero and not day one; days 0-6 therefore correspond to ?completed week zero?; days 7-13 to ?completed week one?; and the 40th week of actual gestation is synonymous with ?completed week 39?.    Where the date of the last normal menstrual period is not available, gestational age should be based on the best clinical estimate. In order to avoid misunderstanding, tabulations should indicate both weeks and days.    Different gestational age groups can be distinguished, compared to the normal time period before giving birth:     pre-term     : less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation;     term     : From 37 completed weeks to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days) of gestation;     post-term     : 42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more) of gestation.

1436;2188;   Organic farming    is a way of agricultural production which uses     organic production    methods and places the highest emphasis on environmental and wildlife protection and, with regard to livestock production, on animal welfare considerations. Organic production involves holistic production management systems for crops and livestock, emphasizing on-farm management practices over off-farm inputs.    This is accomplished by avoiding, or largely reducing, the use of synthetic chemicals such as     fertilisers    ,     pesticides    , (     fungicides    ,     herbicides    ,     insecticides    ), additives and veterinary medicinal products, replacing them, wherever possible, with cultural, biological and mechanical methods. Organic producers develop a healthy, fertile soil by growing and rotating a mixture of crops and using clover to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. The production of genetically-modified (GM) crops and their use in animal feed is avoided.    In the context of     European Union (EU)    statistics, farming is considered to be organic if it complies with     Regulation 834/2007    of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products.

There are two forms of tax credit:    Non-payable tax credits, also known as wastable or less often as non-refundable tax credits, are limited in value to the value of the tax liability. As such, non-payable tax credits can only ever be granted to taxpayers with a non-zero tax liability.     Payable tax credits, also known as non-wastable or refundable tax credits, are not limited and can exceed the value of any tax liability, including a liability of zero, and may therefore be granted to non-taxpayers. The amount of any payable tax credit that exceeds the tax liability is paid directly to the beneficiary in cash. In some cases such credits may even be paid fully in cash.    Payable tax credits are always treated in the same way as cash payments even if part of the value is in practice delivered through reduced taxation.

1455;2212;   Coverage    , is the extent to which the real, observed population matches the ideal or normative population. A population is the domain from which     observations    for a particular topic can be drawn.    Under-coverage    results from the omission of units belonging to the target population, while     over-coverage    occurs due to the inclusion of elements that do not belong to the target population. For instance, for     causes of death    statistics, all deaths of residents occurring in a given year should be covered. However, information about residents dying abroad might not be included in all countries (resulting in under-coverage), and deaths of non-residents might be included (resulting in over-coverage).    An understanding of coverage is required to facilitate the comparison of data. Coverage issues are often explained through the use of tables showing linkages (e.g. part or full correspondence) and can also be used to explain the ratio of coverage. The rules and conventions of coverage are largely determined by concept definitions, scope rules, information requirements and, in the case of statistical collections and classifications, collection and counting units and the collection methodology.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dxB$\xad \x00';

Market output is the output disposed of on the market or intended to be disposed of on the market. Non-market output is provided to other units for free, or at prices that are not economically significant. Ancillary output is intended for use for production activities within an enterprise. Environmental protection ancillary output called 'legally acceptable valuation' is measured as the sum of the components 'compensation of employees' and 'intermediate consumption' for the environmental protection ancillary activity.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dxw\xc1= \x00';
1458;2215;   Foreign affiliates statistics    , abbreviated as     FATS    , describe the activities of     foreign affiliates    : enterprises resident in a country or area, such as the     European Union (EU)    , controlled or owned by (multinational) enterprises which are resident outside that country or area.    Ultimate controlling institutional unit (UCI) of a foreign affiliate    shall mean the institutional unit, moving up a foreign affiliate's chain of control, which is not controlled by another institutional unit. The UCI has a key role in the statistics on globalisation. It determines how a unit should be treated in inward or outward FATS or FDI statistics.    A distinction can be made between     outward FATS    , on the activities of own affiliates abroad and     inward FATS    , on the activities of foreign enterprises within the own country or area.    Inward FATS    describe the overall activity of foreign affiliates resident in the compiling economy. A foreign affiliate within the terms of inward FATS is an enterprise resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit not resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, inward FATS describe how many jobs, how much turnover, etc. are generated by foreign investors in a given EU host economy. While FDI statistics give an idea of the total amount of capital invested by foreigners in the EU economy, FATS add to that information by providing insight into the economic impact those investments have in the EU in terms of job creation, etc.    Control ? in this context ? is the ability to determine the general policy of an enterprise by choosing appropriate directors, if necessary. However, control is often difficult to determine and, in practice, the share of ownership is often used as a proxy for control. FATS thus focus on the affiliates that are majority-owned by a single investor or by a group of associated investors acting in concert and owning more than 50% of ordinary shares or voting power. However, other criteria may also be relevant for defining foreign control, and thus other cases (multiple minority ownership, joint ventures, and qualitative assessment determining control) should be covered as regards assessment of control.    Outward FATS    describe the activity of foreign affiliates abroad controlled by the compiling country. Foreign affiliate within the terms of outward FATS is an enterprise not resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, outward FATS data describe, for example, how many employees work for affiliates of EU enterprises based abroad? In this case outward FATS give an idea of the economic impact of EU investments abroad (e.g. how many employees work for affiliates of German enterprises in China, etc.).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dx\x82a\xdc \x00';

1461;2218;   Sourcing    refers to the total or partial movement of core or support     business functions    of a resident     enterprise    currently performed in-house to either non-affiliated (external suppliers) or affiliated enterprises located either domestically or abroad.    International sourcing    is sourcing to affiliated or non-affiliated enterprises located abroad. This definition excludes, however, the movement of core or support business functions abroad without a reduction of activity and/or jobs in the enterprise concerned - for example, if a new production line is set up abroad without reductions, even if the line also could have been set up in the country for which statistics are compiled, then this does not constitute international sourcing. International sourcing is sometimes also called     off-shoring    ,     near-shoring    ,     delocalisation    or     outsourcing    .  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dx\xab\x82C \x00';
1462;2219;"  The (industrial)     producer price index    , abbreviated as     PPI    and also called     output price index    , is a     business-cycle    indicator showing the development of transaction prices for the monthly industrial output of economic activities.    The PPI does not only serve as an early indicator of     inflationary    pressures in the economy before it reaches the consumer, but it can also record the evolution of prices over longer time periods.    The PPI for a specific     economic activity    measures the monthly change in the trading price of products and related services. The PPI is an output index ? it measures price changes from the seller's perspective. The prices collected in period     t    should refer to orders booked during period     t    (at the moment of the order) and not the moment when the commodities leave the factory gates. Price indices are calculated as a     weighted    average of the relevant products.    PPIs are calculated for the total, the     domestic    and the     non-domestic    markets, with the latter further split between     euro area     and     non-euro area    markets. The indicators of domestic and non-domestic prices require separate producer price indices to be compiled according to the destination of the product. The residency of the third party which has ordered or bought the product defines the destination. The domestic market is defined as all third parties ordering or buying which are residents in the same national territory as the     observation unit    from which sales or orders are collected. When combined, the sub-indices for the domestic and the non-domestic markets give the total change in the PPI for a given product.    The appropriate price for calculating the PPI is the basic price that excludes     VAT    and similar deductible taxes which are directly linked to     turnover    , as well as all duties and taxes on the goods and services invoiced. However, subsidies on products received by the producer, if there are any, should be added to the basic price.    All price-determining characteristics should be taken into account, including the:    quantity of units sold;     transport provided;     rebates;     service conditions;     guarantee conditions;     destination.

Gross value added is defined as the value of all newly generated goods and services less the value of all goods and services consumed in their creation; the depreciation of fixed assets is not included.    When calculating value added, output is valued at basic prices and intermediate consumption at purchasers' prices. Taxes less subsidies on products have to be added to value added to obtain GDP at market prices.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8dx\xd2\x88\x01 \x00';

The SHA provides a standard framework for producing a set of comprehensive, consistent and internationally comparable accounts to meet the needs of public and private sector health analysts and policy-makers. At present, national health accounts are at different stages of development and may not only differ in the boundaries drawn between health and other social and economic activities but also in the classifications used, the level of detail provided, and in the accounting rules. The SHA provides a framework for a family of interrelated tables for standard reporting for expenditure (spending) on health and for its financing. It has been written with the dual aim of providing this framework for international data collections and as a possible model for redesigning and complementing national health accounts to aid policy-makers.    The demand for improved health accounts is driven by an increasing complexity of healthcare systems in many countries and the rapid evolution in medical technology. Policy-makers and observers of healthcare systems and recent reforms have questioned the adequacy of accounting practices and the ability of health accounts to monitor fast-changing healthcare systems that are becoming increasingly complex. Raising consumers? expectations of healthcare contributes to the demand for up-to-date information on healthcare systems.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x98.\xcb\xaa \x00';

1488;2255;"  A common definition of     statistical unit    or     observation unit    , i.e. the unit about which data are collected is a prerequisite for comparable European statistics.     Regulation (EEC) No 696/93    of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community defines eight different types of statistical units.    In short-term business statistics the kind-of-activity unit (KAU) has been established by the     Regulation (EU) No 2019/2152    of 27 November 2019 (European Business Statistics Regulation) as the sole statistical unit (Annex II). In the past two statistical units were used, the KAU for construction and industry, the enterprise for trade and services. For a transition period the enterprise may be used by National Statistical Institutes for trade and industry indicators in short-term statitics.    The     kind-of-activity unit (KAU)    is a part of an enterprise (see below). The KAU groups together all the offices, production facilities etc. of an enterprise which contribute to the performance of a specific economic activity defined at class level (four digits) of the     European classification of economic activities (NACE Rev. 2.)    For example a kind-of-activity unit might be the combination of all parts of a metal producing enterprise that produce copper (class 24.44 in NACE Rev. 2); within the same enterprise there might be another KAU consisting of those parts that produce aluminium (class 24.42 in NACE Rev. 2). In order to statistically subdivide enterprises into KAUs the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus and employment and gross fixed capital formation.    The purpose of the KAU is to improve the homogeneity of statistical surveys by economic activity. In the above example, without the use of KAUs, it might be necessary to classify the enterprise either as a copper manufacturer or as an aluminium manufacturer. In such a way rather diverse enterprises might be considered to engage in the same economic activity which would make statistical results less clear and comparable.    An     enterprise    is an organisational unit producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than one location. An enterprise is not necessarily a sole legal unit but can be a group of legal units.

International sourcing    is sourcing to affiliated or non-affiliated enterprises located abroad. This definition excludes, however, the movement of core or support business functions abroad without a reduction of activity and/or jobs in the enterprise concerned - for example, if a new production line is set up abroad without reductions, even if the line also could have been set up in the country for which statistics are compiled, then this does not constitute international sourcing. International sourcing is sometimes also called     off-shoring    ,     near-shoring    ,     delocalisation    or     outsourcing    .  ;0;0;"b'\x0bBN\x8dz\xc7Z; \x00'";

Buildings do not necessarily need walls. It is sufficient for them to have a roof, but there must be a demarcation which constitutes the individual character of the building to be used separately.    A separate building is any free-standing building; also, in the case of interconnected structures (e.g. semi-detached or terraced houses), any unit separated from other units by a fire wall extending from roof to cellar is considered an individual building. If there is no fire wall the interconnected building units are regarded as individual buildings if they have their own access (own entrance) as well as their own utility system and are separately usable.    For technical reasons, buildings also include separately usable underground constructions which can be entered by persons and are suitable or intended for protecting persons, animals or objects (e.g. underground shelters, underground hospitals, underground shopping centers and workshops, underground garages).    Buildings are subdivided into residential and non-residential buildings.A     residential building    is a building at least half of which is used for residential purposes.

There are two kinds of non-market producers corresponding to the two types of non-market output:    the first type consists of unincorporated enterprises owned by      households     , most or all of whose output is intended for final consumption or      gross fixed capital formation     by those households or enterprises (for example, owner-occupiers or subsistence farmers who sell only a small fraction of their output);     the second type of non-market producer consists of establishments owned by government units or      private non-profit institutions (PNPIs)     that supply goods or services free, or at prices that are not economically significant, to households or the community as a whole. These producers may also have some sales of secondary market output whose prices are intended to cover their costs or earn a surplus (for example, sales of reproductions by non-market museums).

Accounts for each of the operating agencies, subsidiaries etc. making up a group are called     non-consolidated accounts    .    In national accounts, ESA 2010 specifies the differing analytical uses of consolidated and unconsolidated data. Within financial sector accounts, typically consolidated as well as unconsolidated data is reported.

1523;2300;   Exchange rate    is the price of one country?s currency in relation to another.    Exchange rates are classified by the     International Monetary Fund (IMF)    into three broad categories, reflecting the role of the authorities in determining the exchange rates and/or the multiplicity of exchange rates in a country:     market rate     : is used to describe exchange rates set largely by market forces     official rate     : is used to describe the exchange rate determined by authorities     for countries maintaining multiple exchange arrangements, the rates may be labelled      principle rate     ,      secondary rate     and      tertiary rate     .    A     nominal effective exchange rate    is the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-à-vis (as compared with) other currencies weighted by their share in either the country?s international trade or payments.    Real effective exchange rates    take account of price level differences between trading partners. Movements in real effective exchange rates give an indication of the evolution of a country?s aggregate (total) external price competitiveness.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d}\xd9\xe0* \x00';
1524;2301;  The index of     new orders    received (domestic and non-domestic) was a     business cycle    indicator which represented the nominal value of the new orders placed during a certain reference month in an industry. Due to methodological difficulties the publication of this indicator was discontinued with the end of the reference year 2011.    The purpose of the new orders indicators was to serve as a     leading indicator    , i.e. to give a short-term indication of future developments in production and turnover of industries working to orders.    The definition of new orders resembled that of turnover. New orders excluded     VAT    and other deductible taxes or the sale of capital assets but included all invoiced charges (e.g. for transport and packaging ? with the exception of packaging that might be returned after the delivery).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d~\x16\xbcV \x00';
1525;2303;"  The     Treaty on European Union    , abbreviated as     TEU    and also called     Treaty of Maastricht    , was signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. It represents a new stage in European integration since it opens the way to political integration, by creating a     European Union    consisting of three pillars:    the European Communities;     Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP);     police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (JHA).    The Treaty introduces the concept of European citizenship, reinforces the powers of the     European Parliament    and launches     economic and monetary union    . Besides, the EEC becomes the European Community (EC).    Amendments were made to the Treaty of Maastricht by:    the      Treaty of Amsterdam     (1997), which increased the powers of the Union by creating a Community employment policy, transferring to the Communities some of the areas which were previously subject to intergovernmental cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs, introducing measures aimed at bringing the Union closer to its citizens and enabling closer cooperation between certain Member States (enhanced cooperation). It also extended the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting and simplified and renumbered the articles of the Treaties;     the      Treaty of Nice     (2001), which essentially dealt with the institutional problems linked to      enlargement     left unresolved by the Treaty of Amsterdam: the make-up of the      European Commission     , the weighting of votes in the      Council     and the extension of the areas of qualified majority voting; it also simplified the rules on use of the enhanced cooperation procedure and made the judicial system more effective.     the      Treaty of Lisbon     (2007), which gave legal personality to the      European Union     , abolished the previous pillar system, increased the power of the      European Parliament     and involvement of national parliaments in the legislative process of the Union, further extended areas of qualified majority voting (to be changed in 2014 into double majority voting), introduced functions of a President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, included the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union into legally binding acts, and introduced the European Citizens' initiative and the ability of a state to voluntarily withdraw from the EU.

1530;2310;"   Migration    refers to the number of     migrants    , people changing their residence to or from a given area (usually a country) during a given time period (usually one year).    Immigration    is the action by which a person establishes his or her usual residence in the territory of a Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another Member State or a third country (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Immigrant    is a person undertaking an immigration.    Emigration    is the action by which a person, having previously been usually resident in the territory of a Member State, ceases to have his or her usual residence in that Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Emigrant    is a person undertaking an emigration.    Net migration    is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. In the context of the annual demographic balance however, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and natural change; this concept is referred to as     net migration plus statistical adjustment    . The statistics on 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' are therefore affected by all the statistical inaccuracies in the two components of this equation, especially population change. From one country to another 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' may cover, besides the difference between inward and outward migration, other changes observed in the population figures between 1 January in two consecutive years which cannot be attributed to births, deaths, immigration and emigration.    Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment    is the ratio of net migration plus statistical adjustment during the year to the average population in that year.

In addition to financial assets, governments also hold non-financial assets, which are not covered by the financial accounts. Net financial worth is a good measure of the financial position of government at any point in time ? for example, whether it financial assets exceed its liabilities.

Included are     waterways of maritime character    , waterways designated by the reporting country as suitable for navigation primarily by seagoing ships.    A     waterway    is a river, canal, lake or other stretch of water, that is not part of the sea, which through natural or man-made features is suitable for navigation. This term includes both navigable rivers and lakes and navigable canals. The length of rivers and canals is measured in mid-channel. The length of lakes and lagoons is measured along the shortest navigable route between the two most distant points that perform transport operations. A waterway forming a common frontier between two countries is reported by both states. Waterways also include river estuaries, the boundary with the sea being that point nearest the sea where the width of the river is both less than 3 kilometres (km) at low water and less then 5 km at high water.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x80b\\\x88 \x00';

The indicator distinguishes imports from the     euro area    from those arriving from outside the euro area.    The MPI covers mainly manufactured products. Also covered are mining, energy (gas, electricity etc.) and water (i.e. products classified under sections B, to E of the     Statistical classification of products by activity (CPA)    ). Some product groups are however excluded (such as nuclear products, weapons, ships and aircrafts, printing, some repair services and water treatment). Excluded are also the imports by     households    ,     governments    and     non-profit institutions    .    Import prices in the MPI:    include cost, insurance and freight at the national border of the importing country, but not duties or import taxes;     are actual transaction prices (not list prices) including e.g. discounts;     are measured in the currency of the importing EU country. Transactions in other currencies have to be converted (this implies that the MPI is affected by      exchange rate     fluctuations);     must take into account all price determining qualities of the imported products (e.g. servicer and guarantee conditions, included transport costs etc.);     are recorded when ownership is transferred and the index should reflect the average prices during the      reference period     (month).    Import price indices show the development of prices of intermediate products for production and of consumption goods and are an important tool to monitor, analyze and forecast price developments of domestic products.

1572;2368;"   Migration    refers to the number of     migrants    , people changing their residence to or from a given area (usually a country) during a given time period (usually one year).    Immigration    is the action by which a person establishes his or her usual residence in the territory of a Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another Member State or a third country (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Immigrant    is a person undertaking an immigration.    Emigration    is the action by which a person, having previously been usually resident in the territory of a Member State, ceases to have his or her usual residence in that Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Emigrant    is a person undertaking an emigration.    Net migration    is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. In the context of the annual demographic balance however, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and natural change; this concept is referred to as     net migration plus statistical adjustment    . The statistics on 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' are therefore affected by all the statistical inaccuracies in the two components of this equation, especially population change. From one country to another 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' may cover, besides the difference between inward and outward migration, other changes observed in the population figures between 1 January in two consecutive years which cannot be attributed to births, deaths, immigration and emigration.    Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment    is the ratio of net migration plus statistical adjustment during the year to the average population in that year.

The MIGs are effectively at an intermediate level between the NACE sections on the one hand and the divisions and groups on the other. They are useful because the four NACE sections making up industry (Sections B, C, D and E) are often too broad for meaningful analysis, while the 34 divisions into which these four sections are divided, are too numerous and too heterogeneous (in terms of their size) to represent adequately the development of industry over time.

In all     European Union (EU)    and other European countries, contracting a     civil marriage    (before official authorities and on a legal basis) is possible. However, the relation between a civil marriage and a     religious marriage    (before religious representative only) is not the same in all countries. In 15 countries (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden as well as Norway and the United Kingdom) a religious marriage has consequences for the civil marriage in the sense that a religious marriage is recognised by the state as being equivalent to a civil marriage. France states that a religious marriage has no consequences for marital status, unless it has been contracted abroad.

It represents a new stage in European integration since it opens the way to political integration, by creating a     European Union    consisting of three pillars:    the European Communities;     Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP);     police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (JHA).    The Treaty introduces the concept of European citizenship, reinforces the powers of the     European Parliament    and launches     economic and monetary union    .

1618;2434;  The     livestock unit    , abbreviated as     LSU    (or sometimes as     LU    ), is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and age as per convention, via the use of specific coefficients established initially on the basis of the nutritional or feed requirement of each type of animal (see table below for an overview of the most commonly used coefficients).    The reference unit used for the calculation of livestock units (=1 LSU) is the grazing equivalent of one adult     dairy cow    producing 3 000 kg of milk annually, without additional concentrated foodstuffs.    Holdings with livestock can have zero livestock units as LSU is only calculated for bovine animals, goats, sheep, equidae, pigs, poultry, and female breeding rabbits.

1620;2436;   Long-term residence permits    cover all residence permits granted to third country nationals valid for at least five years or more (including permanent residence permits). At EU level, it regards residence permits issued under the EU long-term permit directive adopted by the Council in 2003 (Council     Directive 2003/109/EC    ) which stipulates that Member States shall grant long-term resident status and shall issue long-term residence permits to third-country nationals (non-EU citizens) who have resided legally and continuously within its territory for five years. Denmark, Ireland, EFTA countries and the UK are not bound by this directive. Other EU Member States might have in parallel a national framework for granting long-term permits.    In this context, Eurostat collects data on two distinct categories of long-term residence permits:     EU long-term residence permits     which have been issued under the EU long-term permit directive. The permit shall be valid at least for five years and it shall, upon application if required, be automatically renewable on expiry. Long-term residents shall enjoy equal treatment with nationals as regards for example access to employment, education, recognition of professional diplomas and other qualifications, social rights and tax benefits. It also grants to the owners mobility rights across the EU Member States. Denmark, Ireland, the EFTA countries as well as the UK are not bound by this directive and do not report data under this category.     National long-term residence permits     which have been issued under rules based upon national legislation which are different from the EU directive. The minimum requirement to qualify permit under this category shall be a duration of the permit of at least 5 years.

The KAU groups together all the offices, production facilities etc. of an     enterprise    , which contribute to the performance of a specific economic activity defined at class level (four digits) of the European classification of economic activities (     NACE Rev. 2    .) For example, a kind-of-activity unit might be the combination of all parts of a metal producing enterprise that produce copper (class 24.44 in NACE Rev. 2); within the same enterprise there might be another KAU consisting of those parts that produce aluminium (class 24.42 in NACE Rev. 2). In order to statistically subdivide enterprises into KAUs the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus, employment and gross fixed capital formation.    The purpose of the KAU is to improve the homogeneity of statistical surveys by economic activity. In the above example, without the use of KAUs, it would be necessary to classify the enterprise either as a copper manufacturer or as an aluminium manufacturer. In such a way rather diverse enterprises might be considered to engage in the same economic activity which would make statistical results less clear and comparable.    The local part of a kind of activity units is called local kind-of-activity unit (LKAU), the term establishment is common as well, e.g. in     SNA    or     ISIC    .

1626;2442;  The     location of the farm    is the place where the farm undertakes its main agricultural activity.    The location of land (or livestock) of a farm in different regions is not a criterion for splitting one holding into several ones. The data regarding such holdings is not split by region, and a single agricultural holding has a single location placed in one region.    For the purposes of Integrated Farm Statistics, the geographical location of a holding is established according to the following criteria, in order of preference:    1.    The location of the main agricultural building. For     livestock-specialist holdings    it should be where the livestock is located. For     crop-specialist holdings    and     mixed-farming holdings    it should be the main building of the holding which is usually located close to the agricultural activities.    2.    If there is no agricultural building to which a location of the holding could be attributed:     a.     The location of the majority of the area of the holding     b.     The location of the most important parcel chosen by physical size     c.     The location of the most important parcel chosen by economic size     3.    The location of the farmer's residence if it is not further than 5 km straight from the farm    The location may also be a combination of the above referred criteria, none of the above criteria, or it may be that the criteria are not applicable (e.g. only one     NUTS3    region in the country).    When collecting data for the purposes of Integrated Farm Statistics, the geographical location of a farm is defined as a point, a set of coordinates. In short, there is a record with the X, Y coordinates of a location, along with a unique identifier (ID), which are linked to a record with statistical data which belongs to this point. The process of linking coordinates, identifier and data is called point-based ?     geocoding    ? of statistics. The purpose of using     point-based    geocoding (rather than     area-based    geocoding) is to assign a single coordinate location to each statistical unit about which data is collected.    Defining the geographical location of a farm as a point rather than an area does present certain challenges. Since an agricultural holding is spread over an area, the simple use of address or building locations risks the production of a non-appropriate spatial representation. For example, agricultural holdings may be inappropriately geocoded by using address information when the address location refers to the dwelling of the farmer, rather than to the farm site of the holding. Typically, the farm site and the place of residence of the farmer coincide, but in case the farm site is very different from the residence of the farmer, address geocoding of the agricultural holding may produce different results. Another issue is that all area features, such as the agricultural land belonging to the holding, will be linked to a single point location which will be assigned to a single 1km     2    grid cell. The precise location of the land parcels of the farm is not collected.    Tree  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x87\x1e3\xbd \x00';

1695;2551;   Foreign affiliates statistics    , abbreviated as     FATS    , describe the activities of     foreign affiliates    : enterprises resident in a country or area, such as the     European Union (EU)    , controlled or owned by (multinational) enterprises which are resident outside that country or area.    Ultimate controlling institutional unit (UCI) of a foreign affiliate    shall mean the institutional unit, moving up a foreign affiliate's chain of control, which is not controlled by another institutional unit. The UCI has a key role in the statistics on globalisation. It determines how a unit should be treated in inward or outward FATS or FDI statistics.    A distinction can be made between     outward FATS    , on the activities of own affiliates abroad and     inward FATS    , on the activities of foreign enterprises within the own country or area.    Inward FATS    describe the overall activity of foreign affiliates resident in the compiling economy. A foreign affiliate within the terms of inward FATS is an enterprise resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit not resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, inward FATS describe how many jobs, how much turnover, etc. are generated by foreign investors in a given EU host economy. While FDI statistics give an idea of the total amount of capital invested by foreigners in the EU economy, FATS add to that information by providing insight into the economic impact those investments have in the EU in terms of job creation, etc.    Control ? in this context ? is the ability to determine the general policy of an enterprise by choosing appropriate directors, if necessary. However, control is often difficult to determine and, in practice, the share of ownership is often used as a proxy for control. FATS thus focus on the affiliates that are majority-owned by a single investor or by a group of associated investors acting in concert and owning more than 50% of ordinary shares or voting power. However, other criteria may also be relevant for defining foreign control, and thus other cases (multiple minority ownership, joint ventures, and qualitative assessment determining control) should be covered as regards assessment of control.    Outward FATS    describe the activity of foreign affiliates abroad controlled by the compiling country. Foreign affiliate within the terms of outward FATS is an enterprise not resident in the compiling country over which an institutional unit resident in the compiling country has control. In simpler terms, outward FATS data describe, for example, how many employees work for affiliates of EU enterprises based abroad? In this case outward FATS give an idea of the economic impact of EU investments abroad (e.g. how many employees work for affiliates of German enterprises in China, etc.).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x8eZ\xafU \x00';

The outdoor area that the farmer can potentially irrigate with the equipment and normal volume of water at hand should be recorded regardless of the type of irrigation equipment and method.    Trends in     water abstraction    rates depend on different factors: crop variety (examples of water-intensive crops are potatoes in northern Europe and cotton, grain maize, rice and fruit in southern Europe), irrigation area, irrigation technology, water prices, water restrictions, pumping costs and climate conditions. Farmers may select crops that require more water during the growing season, or that have growth periods more sensitive to soil moisture stress. Because of these varying factors,     irrigated areas    change from year to year and irrigable areas, defined as the total area equipped for irrigation, are used instead to present irrigation trends.

Crops under glass and      kitchen gardens     , which are almost always irrigated, should not be included.     If more than one crop is grown in a field during the harvest year, the area should only be indicated once: for the main crop, if irrigation was used for it, or otherwise for the most important irrigated secondary or successive crop.

1711;2575;   Intensive farming    is a farming system characterised by the significant use of capital and inputs relative to land. Large amounts of capital are necessary to the acquisition and application of fertiliser and     pesticides    to growing crops, and animal     feedingstuff    . Capital is also particularly important to the maintenance of high-efficiency machinery for planting, cultivating, and harvesting, as well as irrigation equipment where that is required. Optimal use of these inputs produces significantly greater crop yields per unit of land than in extensive farming systems, which use less capital and inputs relative to land area.    Intensive farming puts a pressure on the environment, due to the high use of inputs. A high use of fertilisers and pesticides, for instance, increase the risk of nutrients and pesticides run-off into     surface    and     groundwaters    . However, the actual effect of the use of inputs on the environment is not only depending on the amount of inputs used but also on how and when they are applied.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x8f~\xca\xaa \x00';
1712;2576;   Extensive farming    , the opposite of     intensive farming    , is characterised by a low use of capital and labour (e.g.     fertilisers    ,     pesticides    , machinery) relative to land area. The crop yields per unit of land are lower than in intensive agriculture.    Extensive farming in general is more beneficial to the environment. Due to a lower use of fertilisers and pesticides, the risks of nutrient and pesticide run-off into     surface    and     groundwater    are lower. However, the actual effect of the use of inputs on the environment is not only depending on the amount of inputs used, but also on how they are applied. Inputs like fertilisers are also needed to sustain soil fertility, when crops are harvested. Too little use of fertilisers may therefore also lead to environmental degradation.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa5\xc9?y \x00';
1713;2577;"   Integrated pollution prevention and control    , abbreviated as     IPPC    , refers to the minimising of pollution from various industrial sources throughout the     European Union (EU)    , as established by the so-called IPPC Directive (     Directive 2008/1/EC    of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control). The Regulation requires industrial and agricultural activities with a high pollution potential to have a permit; this permit can only be issued if certain environmental conditions are met, so that the companies themselves bear responsibility for preventing and reducing any pollution they may cause. All permit applications must be sent to the competent authority of the Member State concerned, which will then decide whether or not to authorise the activity. The IPPC Directive is based on several principles, namely an integrated approach, best available techniques, flexibility and public participation.    Directive 2008/1/EC replaces     Directive 96/61/EC    , a formal amendment that assembles the original instrument and its subsequent amendments in one single legislative act without however altering its substantive provisions.

1721;2587;   Innovation activities    are all scientific, technological, organisational, financial and commercial steps which actually, or are intended to, lead to the implementation of     innovations    . Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include     research and development (R & D)    that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation.    A common feature of an innovation is that it must have been implemented. A new or improved product is implemented when it is introduced on the market. New     processes    ,     marketing    methods or     organisational methods    are implemented when they are brought into actual use in the firm's operations.    Innovation activities vary greatly in their nature from firm to firm. Some firms engage in well-defined innovation projects, such as the development and introduction of a new product, whereas others primarily make continuous improvements to their products, processes and operations. Both types of firms can be     innovative    : an innovation can consist of the implementation of a single significant change, or of a series of smaller incremental changes that together constitute a significant change.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x90\xc0M\xa1 \x00';

1743;2621;"   Migration    refers to the number of     migrants    , people changing their residence to or from a given area (usually a country) during a given time period (usually one year).    Immigration    is the action by which a person establishes his or her usual residence in the territory of a Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another Member State or a third country (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Immigrant    is a person undertaking an immigration.    Emigration    is the action by which a person, having previously been usually resident in the territory of a Member State, ceases to have his or her usual residence in that Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months (     Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 on Migration and international protection    ).    Emigrant    is a person undertaking an emigration.    Net migration    is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants. In the context of the annual demographic balance however, Eurostat produces net migration figures by taking the difference between total population change and natural change; this concept is referred to as     net migration plus statistical adjustment    . The statistics on 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' are therefore affected by all the statistical inaccuracies in the two components of this equation, especially population change. From one country to another 'net migration plus statistical adjustment' may cover, besides the difference between inward and outward migration, other changes observed in the population figures between 1 January in two consecutive years which cannot be attributed to births, deaths, immigration and emigration.    Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment    is the ratio of net migration plus statistical adjustment during the year to the average population in that year. The value is expressed per 1 000 inhabitants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x93T\xbc\xea \x00';

The IMF was conceived at the Bretton Woods conference in July 1944 (together with the     World Bank    ), came into formal existence in December 1945 with 29 founding member countries and started operations on March 1, 1947. It is a specialised agency of the     United Nations (UN)    , but has its own charter, governing structure, and finances. Its members are represented through a quota system broadly based on their relative size in the global economy.    The IMF promotes international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, facilitates the balanced growth of international trade, and provides resources to help members in balance of payments difficulties or to assist with poverty reduction. Through its economic surveillance, the IMF keeps track of the economic health of its member countries, alerting them to risks on the horizon and providing policy advice. It also lends to countries in difficulty, and provides technical assistance and training to help countries improve economic management.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x93\x8f5\x7f \x00';

The main tasks consist of increasing the existing stock of knowledge, applying scientific and artistic concepts and theories to the solution of problems, and teaching about the foregoing in a systematic manner or any combination of these activities. Most occupations in this major group require skills at the fourth ISCO-08 skill level, usually obtained as a result of tertiary education     ISCED 97    level 5 or 6,     ISCED 2011    level 5 to 8.

1752;2631;"  An     asylum    procedure where an     asylum applicant    lodges an     application for international protection    , can result in different decisions, positive or negative, at the different stages of the procedure.    Asylum decisions can be distinguished according to the     stage in the procedure    when they are taken:     First instance decision     means a decision granted by the respective authority acting as a first instance of the administrative/judicial asylum procedure in the receiving country.     Final decision     means a decision on whether the third-country national or stateless person be granted refugee or subsidiary protection status by virtue of      Directive 2011/95/EU     and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive, irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the Member States concerned pending its outcome. The asylum procedures and the numbers/levels of decision making bodies differ between Member States. The true 'final instance' may be, according to the national legislation and administrative procedures, a decision of the highest national court. However, it is not intended that these statistics should cover rare or exceptional cases determined by the highest courts. Thus, the statistics related to the 'final decisions' should refer to decisions against which there is no further possibility to appeal on the substance of the decision but only on procedural grounds.    For the purpose of the Asylum data collection the concepts of first instance decision and final decision include also data on decisions granting or rejecting 'Humanitarian status' under national law concerning international protection.    Depending on the     outcome    of the decisions, asylum applicants can be categorised in different groups:     Person being a subject of a pending application     means a person who is the subject of an application for international protection under consideration by the responsible national authority at the end of the reference period. It includes the number of persons with pending applications at all instances of the administrative and/or judicial procedure.     Person granted refugee status     means a person covered by a decision granting      refugee     status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Refugee status means status as defined in Art.2(e) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     within the meaning of Art.1 of the      Geneva Convention     relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the      New York Protocol     of 31 January 1967.     Person granted subsidiary protection status     means a person covered by a decision granting subsidiary protection status, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. Subsidiary protection status means status as defined in Art.2(g) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     . According to Art.2(f) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     a person eligible for subsidiary protection means a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as defined in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) does not apply, and is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.     Person granted authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons     means a person covered by a decision granting authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons under national law concerning international protection, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. It includes persons who are not eligible for international protection as currently defined in the first stage legal instruments, but are nonetheless protected against removal under the obligations that are imposed on all Member States by international refugee or human rights instruments or on the basis of principles flowing from such instruments. Examples of such categories include persons who are not removable on ill health grounds and unaccompanied minors.     Person granted temporary protection     means a person covered by a decision granting temporary protection as defined in Art.2(a) of      Council Directive 2001/55/EC     i.e. 'a procedure of exceptional character to provide, in the event of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such persons, in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process this influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation, in the interests of the persons concerned and other persons requesting protection'.     Rejected applicant     means a person covered by a decision rejecting an application for international protection, including decisions considering applications as inadmissible or as unfounded and decisions under priority and accelerated procedures, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period.    Eurostat further produces aggregates of the     Total number of decisions    and the     Total number of positive decisions    issued during a reference period, for each ""stage in the procedure"" (first or final). Thus,     Total number of positive decisions    refers to the sum of decisions granting refugee status, subsidiary protection status, authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons (for countries where applicable) and temporary protection status. Whereas     Total number of decisions    refers to     Total number of positive decisions    plus rejected applicants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x94e\xf0  \x00';

The unit is obtained by comparing an employee's or student's     average number of hours worked    to the average number of hours of a full-time worker or student. A full-time person is therefore counted as one FTE, while a part-time worker / student gets a score in proportion to the hours he or she works or studies. For example, a part-time worker employed for 20 hours a week where full-time work consists of 40 hours, is counted as 0.5 FTE.    The workforce of an     enterprise    , activity, or country etc. can then be added up and expressed as the number of full-time equivalents. In the context of education the FTE unit attempts to standardize a student's actual course load in comparison with the normal course load.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x9f\x0e\xb3\xab \x00';

1784;2681;"  The Harmonised European Time Use Surveys (HETUS) are national surveys examining how much time people spend on various activities, including paid work, household chores and family care, personal care, voluntary work, social life, travel and leisure. They give a picture of time-use patterns in about half the countries of the     European Union (EU)    and     3 non-EU countries (Norway, Serbia and Turkey)    . Data are collected on the basis of a gentleman's agreement between participating countries and Eurostat.    The survey data are published by 3 main indicators:     Time spent     : mean time spent on the activities by all individuals     Participation time     : mean time spent on the activities by those individuals who took part in the activity     Participation rate     : the proportion of individuals per day who spent some time on the activities.    The 3 indicators are compiled by sex and age group; household composition; highest level of education attained; self-declared labour status, according to information on labour status as perceived by the respondent; professional status; day of the week and month of the year.The basic unit of data collection is the household. However, as many participating countries are unable or unwilling to collect data from all individuals in a household, Eurostat's dissemination activities for HETUS focus on individual respondents.    The main classification system used in HETUS is the activity coding list (ACL). This assigns a 3-digit code to the primary activities ('what were you doing?') and the secondary activities ('what else were you doing?') in which respondents are engaged during their day. For that purpose, the 24 hours of the day are split into 144 time slots of 10 minutes each. The activities are described by the respondents themselves and subsequently coded by professional coders, using an activity classification system with over 100 3-digit categories.    Information on     primary    and     secondary activities    is complemented by other classifications describing the location (where time is spent, including modes of transport) and describing 'with whom' time is spent. From round 3 of HETUS (2020) on, participating countries will be offered an additional category of activity for the diary, 'ICT use'. This involves deciding, for each 10-minute time slot, whether the main or secondary activity involves using a computer, a smart device, the internet, an online tool or similar devices.    In round 2 of HETUS, 15 EU countries and 3 non-EU countries collected and transmitted data to Eurostat. 13 EU countries did not conduct a time-use survey during round 2.

It is carried out by each Member State and is used to compile weightings for important macroeconomic indicators, such as     consumer price indices    (used as measures of     inflation    ) and     national accounts    .    The data from the survey are broken down by household characteristics, such as income, socio-economic characteristics, size and composition,     degree of urbanisation    , and region.    Data collection involves a combination of one or more interviews and diaries or logs maintained by households and/or individuals, generally on a daily basis.    The basic unit of data collection and analysis in the surveys is the household. It is important to identify the reference person (often the head of the household) whose personal characteristics can be used in the classification and analysis of information on the household. The socio-economic group, occupation and employment status, income, sex and age of the reference person is often used to classify and present results.    Expenditure made by households to acquire goods and services is recorded at the price actually paid, which includes indirect taxes (     VAT    and excise duties) borne by the purchaser.    Two-thirds of the Member States carry out annual surveys, while the remainder have five-year or even longer intervals between surveys. Probability sampling is used in the large majority of surveys in the EU. The high incidence of non-response is a common and major problem.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x98\xb7Rl \x00';

GISCO also coordinates Commission-wide geographical information activities and common strategies and has the goal to promote and stimulate the use of geographical information within the European Statistical System and the Commission.The main activities consist of the following pillars:    management of the geographical reference database of the European Commission;     operation of the spatial data infrastructure of the European Commission;     data processing, mainly for thematic mapping, spatial analysis, and      data dissemination     ;     coordination and relationships with users and producers (European Commission, European agencies, statistical offices);     promoting activities to integrate geographical information with thematic information, notably statistical information;     cooperation in initiatives for the establishment of a geographical information infrastructure at the European level (      INSPIRE     ).    In addition, GISCO promotes projects to develop links between geographical and statistical data. These projects aim at optimising the use of information already collected to achieve efficiencies in statistical production and to increase the analytical and communication power of the data. GISCO represents Eurostat in the GEOSTAT project and in the     European Forum for Geostatistics    .  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x9e\x08K\x8c \x00';

1840;2765;"  The     gender pay gap    , abbreviated as     GPG    , refers to the difference in average wages between men and women. The unadjusted gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between the average gross hourly     earnings    of male and female paid     employees    as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees.    From the reference year 2006 onwards, the GPG is computed annually in the     European Union (EU)    by the     European statistical system (ESS)    according to 3 main guidelines; the GPG is:    unadjusted, i.e. without correcting for national differences in individual characteristics of employed men and women - the main reason is that, at this stage, there is neither consensus nor scientific evidence on which adjustment method should be used;     calculated using gross hourly earnings - this choice aims at excluding from the measurement differences among EU Member States in terms of use of part time work;     based on a harmonised source across the EU, the      Structure of earnings survey (SES)     , a rich employer-employee matched data set.    More specifically, the unadjusted GPG is calculated:    using the four-yearly Structure of earnings survey (SES) as a benchmark, from the 2006 survey onwards;     using national estimates (based on national sources) provided by Member States for the years between the SES benchmark years, from reference year 2007 onwards (same coverage as SES);     defining the GPG as the relative difference between the average (      arithmetic mean     ) gross hourly earnings of women and men, expressed in %;     with the same coverage as the SES:      no restrictions for age and hours worked, part-timers shall be included;       NACE       Rev. 1.1. aggregate for sections C to O, excluding L (section L and the total C to O are optional) ?

The unadjusted GPG for the     EU    and the     euro area    is calculated by     Eurostat    (only for the aggregated NACE sections B to S without O) as the weighted mean of the gender pay gaps in EU Member States, using the numbers of employees in Member States as weights.

1852;2780;  The basic     Farm structure survey    , abbreviated as     FSS    and also known as     Survey on the structure of agricultural holdings    , is carried out by all     European Union (EU)    Member States. The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to     NUTS    3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a     census    .    The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia.    In 2010 a special survey, the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat.    The countries collect information from individual     agricultural holdings    and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to     Eurostat    . The information collected in the FSS covered     land use    , livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on     Farm structure survey - thresholds    .

1853;2781;  A     full-time equivalent    , sometimes abbreviated as     FTE    , is a unit to measure     employed persons    or students in a way that makes them comparable although they may work or study a different number of hours per week.    The unit is obtained by comparing an employee's or student's     average number of hours worked    to the average number of hours of a full-time worker or student. A full-time person is therefore counted as one FTE, while a part-time worker / student gets a score in proportion to the hours he or she works or studies. For example, a part-time worker employed for 20 hours a week where full-time work consists of 40 hours, is counted as 0.5 FTE.    The workforce of an     enterprise    , activity, or country etc. can then be added up and expressed as the number of full-time equivalents. In the context of education the FTE unit attempts to standardize a student's actual course load in comparison with the normal course load.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\x9fD\xd7? \x00';

1863;2791;   Fossil fuel    is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, coal products, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from plants and animals that existed in the geological past (for example, millions of years ago). Fossil fuels can be also made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels (for example in the oil refinery, crude oil is transformed into motor gasoline).    For decades fossil fuels satisfy most of the human energy requirements.Fossil fuels are carbon-based and their combustion results in the release of carbon into the Earth's atmosphere (carbon that was stored hundreds of millions years ago). It is estimated that roughly 80% of all manmade CO     2    and green-house gas emissions originate from fossil fuels combustion.

The financial corporations sector is defined in ESA 2010 paragraph 2.55.    The financial corporations sector consists of institutional units which are independent legal entities and market producers, and whose principal activity is the production of financial services. Such institutional units comprise all corporations and quasi-corporations which are principallyengaged in:    (a) financial intermediation (financial intermediaries);    and/or    (b) auxiliary financial activities (financial auxiliaries).    Also included are institutional units providing financial services, where most of either their assets or their liabilities are not transacted on open markets.    Financial intermediation is defined in ESA 2010 paragraph 2.56.    Financial intermediation is the activity in which an institutional unit acquires financial assets and incurs liabilities on its own account by engagingin financial transactions on the market. The assets and liabilities of financial intermediaries are transformed or repackaged in relation to, for example, maturity, scale, risk, etc. in the financial intermediation process.

A financial transaction between institutional units is a simultaneous creation or liquidation of a financial asset and the counterpart liability, or a change in ownership of a financial asset, or an assumption of a liability (ESA 2010 paragraph 5.02). Financial transactions describe the net acquisition of financial assets or the net incurrence of liabilities for each type of financial instrument. Such transactions occur both as counterparts of non-financial transactions, and as transactions involving only financial instruments    In the ESA 2010 sequence of accounts, financial transactions are recorded in the     financial account    , which has the balancing item net financial transactions (B.9f), defined as the difference between net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of financial liabilities.

These assets are stores of value representing a benefit or series of benefits accruing to the economic owner through holding or using the assets over a period of time. They are a means of carrying forward value from one accounting period to another. By contrast, financial liabilities are established when debtors are obliged to provide a payment or a series of payments to creditors.    The classification of financial assets and liabilities corresponds to the classification of financial transactions. Financial assets and liabilities as negotiable financial instruments are valued at market value; these values should exclude commissions, fees and taxes. Financial instruments that are non-negotiable are valued at nominal value. These assets/liabilities include:     Monetary gold and special drawing rights (SDRs)     : the former is gold bullion held by financial authorities (or others subject to effective control by such authorities) as a reserve asset against which no outstanding financial liability exists; the latter is an international reserve asset created by the      International Monetary Fund (IMF)     .     Currency and deposits     : the former is composed of banknotes and coins issued by monetary authorities; the latter are exchangeable for currency on demand and may be used directly for making payments by cheque, giro, direct debit, and so on.     Debt securities     : negotiable financial instruments (legal ownership of which may be transferred) that must be designed for potential trading on an organised exchange or in the over-the-counter market.     Loans     : financial assets created when creditors lend funds to debtors, either directly or through brokers, which are either evidenced by non-negotiable documents or not evidenced by documents.     Equity and investment fund shares or units     : composed of financial assets that represent property rights on corporations or quasi-corporations (such assets generally entitle the holders to a share of profit, and to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation).     Insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes     : composed of financial assets of policy holders or beneficiaries and financial liabilities of insurers, pension funds, or issuers of standardised guarantees.     Financial derivatives and employee stock options     : financial assets linked to a financial asset, a non-financial asset or an index, through which specific financial risks can be traded in financial markets in their own right (for example, options, forwards and credit derivatives, or agreements for the purchase of an employer?s stock at a stated price).     Other accounts receivable/payable     : financial assets that are created as a counterpart of a financial or a non-financial transaction in cases where there is a timing difference between this transaction and the corresponding payment (for example, the direct extension of credit by suppliers, advances for work that is in progress or has yet to be undertaken, or prepayment for goods/services that have yet to be delivered).

Person granted temporary protection     means a person covered by a decision granting temporary protection as defined in Art.2(a) of      Council Directive 2001/55/EC     i.e. 'a procedure of exceptional character to provide, in the event of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such persons, in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process this influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation, in the interests of the persons concerned and other persons requesting protection'.     Rejected applicant     means a person covered by a decision rejecting an application for international protection, including decisions considering applications as inadmissible or as unfounded and decisions under priority and accelerated procedures, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period.    Eurostat further produces aggregates of the     Total number of decisions    and the     Total number of positive decisions    issued during a reference period, for each ""stage in the procedure"" (first or final). Thus,     Total number of positive decisions    refers to the sum of decisions granting refugee status, subsidiary protection status, authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons (for countries where applicable) and temporary protection status. Whereas     Total number of decisions    refers to     Total number of positive decisions    plus rejected applicants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa4C\xd9\x8c \x00';

1894;2833;"  An     agricultural holding    can be described by its activities (raising     cattle    , raising     pigs    , cultivating arable crops, horticulture, etc). Some farms earn income from only one specific activity, while others diversify their activities.     Farm specialisation    describes the trend towards a single dominant activity in farm income: an agricultural holding is said to be specialised when a particular activity provides at least two thirds of the production or the business size of an agricultural holding.     Farm diversification    is the opposite of specialisation: it refers to the trend towards gaining income from diverse activities.    Farms are classified into different types according to their dominant activity:    a      crop-specialist holding     is an agricultural holding where crop production is the dominant activity, providing at least two-thirds of the production or the business size of an agricultural holding     a      livestock-specialist holding     is an agricultural holding where livestock production is the dominant activity, providing at least two-thirds of the production or the business size of an agricultural holding     a      mixed-farming holding     is an agricultural holding where neither livestock nor crop production is the dominant activity - an activity is called dominant if it provides at least two-thirds of the production or the business size of an agricultural holding    The production or business size of the holding can be calculated by     standard gross margin (SGM)    or by     standard output (SO)    . Until 2007 the     Farm structure survey (FSS)    and the     Farm accountancy data network (FADN)    have used standard gross margin (SGM) to classify agricultural holdings by type of farming and by     economic size    (     Decision 0377/1985    ). In the FSS 2010 and onward this classification uses standard output (SO) instead (for more detail see     Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008    ). The principle of both concepts is the same; only the way they are calculated differs and therefore the results are not directly comparable. Currently data based on SO are available for 2007 on.

The term is used in the context of external trade, balance of payments, foreign direct investment, migration, transport, tourism and similar statistical areas where goods, capital or people moving in and out of the EU are being measured and where the EU as a whole is considered in relationship to the rest of the world. Extra-EU transactions of the EU as a whole are the sum of the extra-EU transactions of the EU Member States.    Intra-EU    , on the other hand, refers to all transactions occurring     within the EU    . The term can have a different coverage, depending on the perspective taken: the EU as a whole, a Member State, a region or a city, a port or an airport, ...    The exports of a particular Member State, for instance, can be split into two parts, on the one hand to the countries outside the EU, the rest of the world, 'extra-EU', and on the other to the other Member States, 'intra-EU'. Departures from an airport can be 'extra-EU' or 'intra-EU', in the latter case they also include domestic flights, within the Member State.    To complicate matters, the EU has not always had the same composition, due to consecutive     enlargements    . For this reason, both terms are sometimes further qualified as 'extra-EU-15', 'intra-EU-25' etc.; 'extra-EU-15', for instance, refers to the rest of the world apart from the 15 Member States that in the past made up     EU-15    .

1900;2839;   Metadata    can be defined as information that is needed to be able to use and interpret statistics. Metadata describe data by giving definitions of populations, objects, variables, the methodology and quality.    A distinction is generally made between structural and reference metadata.     Structural metadata     are used to identify, formally describe or retrieve statistical data, such as dimension names, variable names, dictionaries, dataset technical descriptions, dataset locations, keywords for finding data etc. For example, structural metadata refer to the titles of the variables and dimensions of statistical datasets, as well as the units employed, code lists (e.g. for territorial coding), data formats, potential value ranges, time dimensions, value ranges of flags, classifications used, etc.     Reference metadata     (sometimes called      explanatory metadata     ) describe the contents and the quality of the statistical data from a semantic point of view. They include explanatory texts on the context of the statistical data, methodologies for data collection and data aggregation as well as quality and dissemination characteristics. In      Eurostat     this information is presented in files based on a standardised format called ESMS (Euro SDMX Metadata Structure) This standard is based on previous standards (including the Standard Data Dissemination Standard developed by the      International Monetary Fund     ) but has been substantially extended in order to include more information on data quality.

1903;2842;  The     expenditure approach    of     GDP    is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.    In the system of     national accounts    , only households,     non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH)    and government have final consumption, whereas corporations have intermediate consumption. Private final consumption expenditure is defined as expenditure on goods and services for the direct satisfaction of individual needs, whereas government consumption expenditure includes goods and services produced by government, as well as purchases of goods and services by government that are supplied to households as social transfers in kind.     Gross capital formation    is the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the     change in inventories    (stocks). The external balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods and services. Depending on the size of exports and imports, it can be positive (a surplus) or negative (a deficit).  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa6\x95\xd65 \x00';

1906;2845;"  Eurostat's database (Eurobase) is often described or associated with different concepts with which a user might not be familiar. This specific terminology is defined here.    Datasets (multi-dimensional tables)    A dataset is a multi-dimensional table used to store the base data, more appropriate for use by statistical and other experts via special applications. Datasets might have up to 8 dimensions. They are accessible online through the Data Explorer in     Database by theme    and in the     bulk download    (see 'Data').    Main tables (predefined tables)    Main tables (predefined tables) are used to provide easy access to the main statistical indicators. They are based in general on datasets and are derived from them     [1]     . They are predefined, non-modifiable and presented as two or three dimensional tables. They are accessible through the TGM (Tables, Graphs and Maps) in     Tables by themes    and     Tables on EU policy    and in the     bulk download    .    Please note that ""Tables on EU policy"" presents a selection of main tables grouped according to specific EU policies, i.e. all main tables available in ""Tables on EU policy"" can also be found in ""Tables by themes"".    Code lists (dictionaries)    Code lists are structural metadata. They provide the coding for the dimensions used in a table, e.g. UNIT, AGE, SEX, etc. All code lists currently used in Eurobase are available in the     code list    (see 'dic'), in EN, FR and DE. Code lists are very relevant when writing table titles: the terminology used in table titles should be coherent with code lists where applicable.

It may occur naturally but can also be the result of human activity (fertiliser run-off, sewage discharge).    These nutrients typically promote excessive growth of algae. As the algae die and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposing organisms deplete the water of available oxygen, causing the death of other organisms, such as fish.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa7\n92 \x00';
1909;2850;"  The     European Union institutions    , sometimes abbreviated as     EUI    , comprises three main     European Union (EU)    institutions:    The      European Parliament (EP)     , which represents EU citizens and is directly elected by them;     The      Council of the European Union     , which represents the individual Member States;     The      European Commission (EC)     , which seeks to uphold the interests of the Union as a whole.    The European Union (EU) is not a federation like the United States, nor is it simply an organisation for co-operation between governments, like the     United Nations (UN)    ; it is, in fact, unique. The countries that make up the EU (its Member States) remain independent sovereign nations but they pool their sovereignty in order to gain the strength and world influence none of them could have on their own.Pooling sovereignty means, in practice, that the Member States delegate some of their decision-making powers to shared institutions they have created, so that decisions on specific matters of joint interest can be made democratically at European level.    The EU's     decision-making process    in general and the     co-decision procedure    in particular involve the three main institutions. This ?institutional triangle? produces the policies and laws that apply throughout the EU. In principle, it is the Commission that proposes new laws, but it is the Parliament and Council that adopt them. The Commission and the Member States then implement them, and the Commission ensures that the laws are properly taken onboard.    Two other institutions have a vital part to play: the     Court of Justice    upholds the rule of European law, and the     Court of Auditors    checks the financing of the Union?s activities.    The powers and responsibilities of these institutions are laid down in the Treaties, which are the foundation of everything the EU does. They also lay down the rules and procedures that the EU institutions must follow. The Treaties are agreed by the presidents and/or prime ministers of all the EU countries, and ratified by their parliaments.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa72\xe3v \x00';

Final decision     means a decision on whether the third-country national or stateless person be granted refugee or subsidiary protection status by virtue of      Directive 2011/95/EU     and which is no longer subject to a remedy within the framework of Chapter V of this Directive, irrespective of whether such remedy has the effect of allowing applicants to remain in the Member States concerned pending its outcome. The asylum procedures and the numbers/levels of decision making bodies differ between Member States. The true 'final instance' may be, according to the national legislation and administrative procedures, a decision of the highest national court. However, it is not intended that these statistics should cover rare or exceptional cases determined by the highest courts. Thus, the statistics related to the 'final decisions' should refer to decisions against which there is no further possibility to appeal on the substance of the decision but only on procedural grounds.    For the purpose of the Asylum data collection the concepts of first instance decision and final decision include also data on decisions granting or rejecting 'Humanitarian status' under national law concerning international protection.

According to Art.2(f) of      Directive 2011/95/EU     a person eligible for subsidiary protection means a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the case of a stateless person, to his or her country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as defined in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) does not apply, and is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.     Person granted authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons     means a person covered by a decision granting authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons under national law concerning international protection, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period. It includes persons who are not eligible for international protection as currently defined in the first stage legal instruments, but are nonetheless protected against removal under the obligations that are imposed on all Member States by international refugee or human rights instruments or on the basis of principles flowing from such instruments. Examples of such categories include persons who are not removable on ill health grounds and unaccompanied minors.     Person granted temporary protection     means a person covered by a decision granting temporary protection as defined in Art.2(a) of      Council Directive 2001/55/EC     i.e. 'a procedure of exceptional character to provide, in the event of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such persons, in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process this influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation, in the interests of the persons concerned and other persons requesting protection'.     Rejected applicant     means a person covered by a decision rejecting an application for international protection, including decisions considering applications as inadmissible or as unfounded and decisions under priority and accelerated procedures, taken by administrative or judicial bodies during the reference period.    Eurostat further produces aggregates of the     Total number of decisions    and the     Total number of positive decisions    issued during a reference period, for each ""stage in the procedure"" (first or final). Thus,     Total number of positive decisions    refers to the sum of decisions granting refugee status, subsidiary protection status, authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons (for countries where applicable) and temporary protection status. Whereas     Total number of decisions    refers to     Total number of positive decisions    plus rejected applicants.  ";0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa8\xc6\xc8\xf1 \x00';
1919;2861;  The     at-risk-of-poverty rate    is the share of people with an     equivalised disposable income    (after social transfer) below the     at-risk-of-poverty threshold    , which is set at 60 % of the national     median    equivalised disposable income after     social transfers    .    This indicator does not measure wealth or poverty, but low income in comparison to other residents in that country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living.    The     at-risk-of-poverty rate before social transfers    is calculated as the share of people having an equivalised disposable income before social transfers that is below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold calculated after social transfers. Pensions, such as old-age and survivors? (widows' and widowers') benefits, are counted as income (before social transfers) and not as social transfers. This indicator examines the hypothetical non-existence of social transfers.    The     persistent at-risk-of-poverty rate    shows the percentage of the population living in households where the equivalised disposable income was below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold for the current year and at least two out of the preceding three years.

The numerator of the indicator refers to persons meeting these two conditions:    they are not employed (i.e.      unemployed     or      inactive     according to the      International Labour Organisation     definition);     they have not received any formal or non-formal education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey.

1921;2864;"   Autopsy    , sometimes also called     post-mortem examination    ,     section    or     necropsy    , is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the     cause    and manner of a person's     death    and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. It involves the cutting up of the body, exclusively external examination of the body without section is excluded from the definition.    An autopsy can be the result of a legal procedure or due to medical reasons.    In some countries, autopsy does not imply the cutting up of the body, but merely denotes an external visual inspection of the deceased; this meaning is to be avoided in international contexts.

1922;2865;  A     primary market    is a financial market where new issues (initial public offerings) of stocks (shares) and bonds (fixed interest financial assets) are sold, and where the proceeds go to the issuer.    After buying in the primary market, the new share or bond owners can sell them in the     secondary market    . This is the market where shares and bonds are bought and sold between the time they were issued at first and before they mature (their end date). Many shares and bonds are sold and bought several times by different investors before they mature. The existence of a liquid (easy to be turned into cash) secondary market can encourage people to buy new issues in the primary market, as it means that it is much more likely that they will be able to sell them easily if they want to.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa9D\x1a\xe8 \x00';
1923;2866;  The     allocation of primary income account    of the     national accounts (NA)    focuses on     resident institutional units    or sectors in their capacity as recipients of primary incomes rather than as producers whose activities generate primary incomes.    It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources':    primary incomes already recorded in the      generation of income account     that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly      operating surplus     and mixed income,      compensation     of employees)     property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial      asset     or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit (      interest     ,      dividends     , withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of      foreign direct investment     , rents on land).    Property income paid is recorded under 'uses'.    The balancing item of the allocation of primary income account is called 'balance of primary income' for sectors and sub-sectors and 'national income' for the total economy. When the balancing item includes     consumption of fixed capital (CFC)    , it is called 'gross balance of primary income' and '     gross national income (GNI)    ', respectively. After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively.    The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the     institutional sectors    and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa9R\r\x80 \x00';
1924;2867;"  A     commodity    , also called     primary product    or     primary good    , is a good sold for production or consumption just as it was found in nature. Commodities include crude oil, coal, copper or iron ore, rough diamonds, and agricultural products such as wheat, coffee beans or cotton; they are often traded on commodity exchanges.    The     Standard international trade classification    distinguishes five main categories (sections) of commodities or primary goods:    Food and live animals (SITC 0 );     Beverages and tobacco (SITC 1);     Crude materials, excluding fuels (SITC 2);     Mineral fuels (SITC 3);     Animal and vegetable oils, fats and waxes (SITC 4).

1925;2868;   Economic activities    are determined by reference to a specific level of the activity classification called     NACE    .    If a     statistical unit    carries out more than one activity, all the activities which are not ancillary activities are ranked according to the gross value added at factor cost which they generate. A distinction is made between     principal activity    and secondary activities.    If no value-added figures are available, other criteria must be used, such as, for example, employment, payroll, turnover and assets, with a view to obtaining the closest possible approximation of the classification which would have been obtained on the basis of value added.    Units are classified in terms of their activities. If one activity accounts for over 50 % of the value added this determines the classification of the unit. In all other cases, classification rules must be observed. Classification is carried out in stages from the highest level of aggregation which is the section (one letter), down to the class (four digits) via the division (two digits) and the group (three digits). The classification at each level must be compatible with the previous level.    Principal and secondary activities are backed up by ancillary activities, such as, for example, administration, accounts, data processing, process monitoring, purchasing, sales and marketing, warehousing, repairs, transport and renovation.    These ancillary activities within a unit are carried out in order to permit or facilitate production by the unit of goods and services for third parties. The products of ancillary activities are not themselves supplied to third parties.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa9}W\xf1 \x00';

This occurs either when natural sources are exploited (for example, in coal mines, crude oil fields, hydro power plants) or in the fabrication of     biofuels    .    Transforming energy from one form into another, such as electricity or heat generation in thermal power plants (where primary energy sources are burned), or coke production in coke ovens, is not primary production.  ;0;0;b'\x0bBN\x8d\xa9\x9d\x8f\x9c \x00';
1928;2872;"  A     physician    or (medical) doctor has a degree in medicine. Physicians may be described as practising, professionally active or licensed.    A     practising physician    provides services directly to patients as consumers of healthcare. These services include:    conducting medical examinations and making diagnoses;     prescribing medication and treating diagnosed illnesses, disorders or injuries;     giving specialised medical or surgical treatment for particular illnesses, disorders or injuries;     giving advice on and applying preventive medical methods and treatments.    A     professionally active physician    is a practising physician or any other physician for whom medical education is a prerequisite for the execution of the job (practising medicine as defined above or, for example, verifying medical absences from work, drug testing, medical research, ...).    A     licensed physician    is a physician ?licensed to practise?; this category includes practising physicians, professionally active physicians, as well as all registered physicians who are entitled to practise as healthcare professionals.

1929;2873;   Sourcing    refers to the total or partial movement of core or support     business functions    of a resident     enterprise    currently performed in-house to either non-affiliated (external suppliers) or affiliated enterprises located either domestically or abroad.    International sourcing    is sourcing to affiliated or non-affiliated enterprises located abroad. This definition excludes, however, the movement of core or support business functions abroad without a reduction of activity and/or jobs in the enterprise concerned - for example, if a new production line is set up abroad without reductions, even if the line also could have been set up in the country for which statistics are compiled, then this does not constitute international sourcing.

There can be different reasons for setting up a SPE:    to protect a company from financial risk, often in the context of a large project;     to separate different layers of equity infusion in complex financing operations;     to own and more easily dispose of assets and associated permits and rights;     to engage in a public-private partnership relying on a project-finance structure.    As there is no universally accepted definition of a special-purpose entity yet, not all of the above-mentioned characteristics or reasons have to be applied to be called such.    A     multinational enterprise (MNE)    often diversifies its investments geographically through a SPE; examples are financing subsidiaries, conduits, holding companies, shell companies, shelf companies and brass-plate companies.

1936;2881;  A     statistical indicator    is the representation of statistical data for a specified time, place or any other relevant characteristic, corrected for at least one dimension (usually size) so as to allow for meaningful comparisons.    It is a summary measure related to a key issue or phenomenon and derived from a series of observed facts. Indicators can be used to reveal relative positions or show positive or negative change. Indicators are usually a direct input into     European Union (EU)    and global policies. In strategic policy fields they are important for setting targets and monitoring their achievement.    By themselves, indicators do not necessarily contain all aspects of development or change, but they hugely contribute to explaining them.
