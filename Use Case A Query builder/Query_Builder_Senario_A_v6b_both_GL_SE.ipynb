       "      <td>The basic     Farm structure survey    , abbreviated as     FSS    and also known as     Survey on the structure of agricultural holdings    , is carried out by all     European Union (EU)    Member States. The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to     NUTS    3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a     census    .    The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia.    In 2010 a special survey, the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat.    The countries collect information from individual     agricultural holdings    and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to     Eurostat    . The information collected in the FSS covered     land use    , livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on     Farm structure survey - thresholds    .    The legal basis for the FSS was     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88    .    The     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    on farm structure surveys ceased to provide statistical information as of 2018. It was repealed by     Regulation (EC) No 2018/1091    .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The     standard output    of an agricultural product (crop or livestock), abbreviated as     SO    , is the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare or per head of livestock.    There is a regional SO coefficient for each product, as an average value over a reference period (5 years, except for the SO 2004 coefficient calculated using the average of 3 years). The sum of all the SO per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall     economic size    , expressed in euro.    The standard output is used to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size.    The common classification of holdings is built on different nested levels. Homogeneous groups of holdings can be assembled in a greater or lower degree of aggregation. Depending on the amount of details required, the types of farming are divided into :    general types of farming (1 digit),      principal types of farming (2 digits),        particular types of farming (3 digits), in earlier years in a few cases split into subdivisions of          particular types of farming (4 digits).       Table 1 shows the changes in the classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming between the Farm structure surveys 1985 and 2016.     Table 1: Classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming and by survey year      Until 2007 the     Farm structure survey (FSS    ) and the Farm accountancy data network (FADN) have used     standard gross margin (SGM)    to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size (     Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985    ). From FSS 2010 this classification uses standard output (SO) instead of SGM according to     Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008    , which is replaced by     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014    for FSS 2016 and onwards.    The principle of both concepts SGM and SO is the same; only the way they are calculated differs:    SGM = Output + Direct Payments â Costs     SO= Output    The decision to leave SGM was driven by the     CAP    moving from coupled to decoupled payments. Since decoupled direct payments cannot be attributed to any specific production, they were excluded from the calculation. If the cost were kept in the calculation there would be the possibility of negative SGM values in cases where costs were higher that the output. Therefore only the output is taken into account.    The main differences between SO and SGM are:    SO excludes direct payments and includes the production costs;     the fodder requirement in the case of some livestock characteristics is included in the calculation of the SO;     the unit used to measure SO is the euro and not      ESU     (1 200 Euro) as in the SGM classification.    The farm structure survey online database is only available from 1990 onwards.    Figure 1 shows the use of SO and SGM coefficients in Farm structure surveys in the period 1990-2016.

It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources':    primary incomes already recorded in the      generation of income account     that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly      operating surplus     and mixed income,      compensation     of employees)     property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial      asset     or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit (      interest     ,      dividends     , withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of      foreign direct investment     , rents on land).    Property income paid is recorded under 'uses'.    The balancing item of the allocation of primary income account is called 'balance of primary income' for sectors and sub-sectors and 'national income' for the total economy. When the balancing item includes     consumption of fixed capital (CFC)    , it is called 'gross balance of primary income' and '     gross national income (GNI)    ', respectively. After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively.    The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the     institutional sectors    and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.</td>\n",

The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to     NUTS    3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a     census    .    The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia.    In 2010 a special survey, the     Survey on agricultural production methods    (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat.    The countries collect information from individual     agricultural holdings    and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to     Eurostat    . The information collected in the FSS covered     land use    , livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type.    The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on     Farm structure survey - thresholds    .    The legal basis for the FSS was     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed     Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88    .    The     Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008    on farm structure surveys ceased to provide statistical information as of 2018. It was repealed by     Regulation (EC) No 2018/1091    .     \n",
       "1                                                                                                                     The     standard output    of an agricultural product (crop or livestock), abbreviated as     SO    , is the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare or per head of livestock.    There is a regional SO coefficient for each product, as an average value over a reference period (5 years, except for the SO 2004 coefficient calculated using the average of 3 years). The sum of all the SO per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall     economic size    , expressed in euro.    The standard output is used to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size.    The common classification of holdings is built on different nested levels. Homogeneous groups of holdings can be assembled in a greater or lower degree of aggregation. Depending on the amount of details required, the types of farming are divided into :    general types of farming (1 digit),      principal types of farming (2 digits),        particular types of farming (3 digits), in earlier years in a few cases split into subdivisions of          particular types of farming (4 digits).       Table 1 shows the changes in the classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming between the Farm structure surveys 1985 and 2016.     Table 1: Classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming and by survey year      Until 2007 the     Farm structure survey (FSS    ) and the Farm accountancy data network (FADN) have used     standard gross margin (SGM)    to classify     agricultural holdings    by type of farming and by economic size (     Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985    ). From FSS 2010 this classification uses standard output (SO) instead of SGM according to     Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008    , which is replaced by     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014    for FSS 2016 and onwards.    The principle of both concepts SGM and SO is the same; only the way they are calculated differs:    SGM = Output + Direct Payments â Costs     SO= Output    The decision to leave SGM was driven by the     CAP    moving from coupled to decoupled payments. Since decoupled direct payments cannot be attributed to any specific production, they were excluded from the calculation. If the cost were kept in the calculation there would be the possibility of negative SGM values in cases where costs were higher that the output. Therefore only the output is taken into account.    The main differences between SO and SGM are:    SO excludes direct payments and includes the production costs;     the fodder requirement in the case of some livestock characteristics is included in the calculation of the SO;     the unit used to measure SO is the euro and not      ESU     (1 200 Euro) as in the SGM classification.    The farm structure survey online database is only available from 1990 onwards.    Figure 1 shows the use of SO and SGM coefficients in Farm structure surveys in the period 1990-2016.

It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources':    primary incomes already recorded in the      generation of income account     that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly      operating surplus     and mixed income,      compensation     of employees)     property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial      asset     or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit (      interest     ,      dividends     , withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of      foreign direct investment     , rents on land).    Property income paid is recorded under 'uses'.    The balancing item of the allocation of primary income account is called 'balance of primary income' for sectors and sub-sectors and 'national income' for the total economy. When the balancing item includes     consumption of fixed capital (CFC)    , it is called 'gross balance of primary income' and '     gross national income (GNI)    ', respectively. After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively.    The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the     institutional sectors    and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.     \n",
       "3    Member States of the     European Union (EU)    and other countries have been assigned a two-letter     country code    , always written in capital letters, and often used as an abbreviation in statistical analyses, tables, figures or maps.    The     protocol order    in which countries are often listed is based on the alphabetical list of countries in their national language for EU and     EFTA    Member States and for     candidate countries    ; for     potential candidates    , it is based on the alphabetical order of their country code.

Its stated mission is to advance opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive employment in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.    The ILO was founded in 1919, in the wake of World War I, to pursue a vision based on the premise that universal, lasting peace can only occur if based on the decent treatment of working women and men. In 1946 it became the UN's first specialised agency, with as main objectives to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue concerning work-related issues.    The ILO is the global body responsible for drafting and overseeing international labour standards. Working with its Member States, the ILO seeks to ensure that labour standards are respected in practice, as well as in principle.     \n",

       "      <td>The basic Farm structure survey, abbreviated as FSS and also known as Survey on the structure of agricultural holdings, is carried out by all European Union (EU) Member States. The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to NUTS 3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a census. The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia. In 2010 a special survey, the Survey on agricultural production methods (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat. The countries collect information from individual agricultural holdings and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to Eurostat. The information collected in the FSS covered land use, livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type. The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on Farm structure survey - thresholds. The legal basis for the FSS was Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88. The Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 on farm structure surveys ceased to provide statistical information as of 2018. It was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 2018/1091.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The standard output of an agricultural product (crop or livestock), abbreviated as SO, is the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare or per head of livestock. There is a regional SO coefficient for each product, as an average value over a reference period (5 years, except for the SO 2004 coefficient calculated using the average of 3 years). The sum of all the SO per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall economic size, expressed in euro. The standard output is used to classify agricultural holdings by type of farming and by economic size. The common classification of holdings is built on different nested levels. Homogeneous groups of holdings can be assembled in a greater or lower degree of aggregation. Depending on the amount of details required, the types of farming are divided into : general types of farming (1 digit), principal types of farming (2 digits), particular types of farming (3 digits), in earlier years in a few cases split into subdivisions of particular types of farming (4 digits). Table 1 shows the changes in the classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming between the Farm structure surveys 1985 and 2016. Table 1: Classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming and by survey year Until 2007 the Farm structure survey (FSS ) and the Farm accountancy data network (FADN) have used standard gross margin (SGM) to classify agricultural holdings by type of farming and by economic size ( Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985 ). From FSS 2010 this classification uses standard output (SO) instead of SGM according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008, which is replaced by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014 for FSS 2016 and onwards. The principle of both concepts SGM and SO is the same; only the way they are calculated differs: SGM = Output + Direct Payments a Costs SO= Output The decision to leave SGM was driven by the CAP moving from coupled to decoupled payments. Since decoupled direct payments cannot be attributed to any specific production, they were excluded from the calculation. If the cost were kept in the calculation there would be the possibility of negative SGM values in cases where costs were higher that the output. Therefore only the output is taken into account. The main differences between SO and SGM are: SO excludes direct payments and includes the production costs; the fodder requirement in the case of some livestock characteristics is included in the calculation of the SO; the unit used to measure SO is the euro and not ESU (1200 Euro) as in the SGM classification. The farm structure survey online database is only available from 1990 onwards. Figure 1 shows the use of SO and SGM coefficients in Farm structure surveys in the period 1990-2016.

It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources': primary incomes already recorded in the generation of income account that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly operating surplus and mixed income, compensation of employees) property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial asset or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit ( interest, dividends, withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of foreign direct investment, rents on land). Property income paid is recorded under 'uses'. The balancing item of the allocation of primary income account is called 'balance of primary income' for sectors and sub-sectors and 'national income' for the total economy. When the balancing item includes consumption of fixed capital (CFC), it is called 'gross balance of primary income' and ' gross national income (GNI) ', respectively. After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively. The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the institutional sectors and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.</td>\n",

The ILO was founded in 1919, in the wake of World War I, to pursue a vision based on the premise that universal, lasting peace can only occur if based on the decent treatment of working women and men. In 1946 it became the UN's first specialised agency, with as main objectives to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue concerning work-related issues. The ILO is the global body responsible for drafting and overseeing international labour standards.

The FSS is conducted consistently throughout the EU with a common methodology on a regular basis and provides therefore comparable and representative statistics across countries and time, at regional levels (down to NUTS 3 level). Every 3 or 4 years the FSS is carried out as a sample survey, and once in ten years as a census. The 2000 census covered the 15 Member States at that time, plus Latvia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Norway, while the 2010 census covered the 27 Member States at that time, plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and Serbia. In 2010 a special survey, the Survey on agricultural production methods (SAPM) was carried out. SAPM was carried out together with the 2010 census in some countries, whereas in other countries SAPM was carried out as a sample survey and data were linked to data of the census at the level of the individual holding to enable cross comparisons of variables collected in both SAPM and the census. Sample surveys of 2003, 2005 and 2007 covered the EU-27 Member States. In 2013 and 2016, the survey covered the EU-28 Member States. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia also send farm structure data to Eurostat. The countries collect information from individual agricultural holdings and, observing strict rules of confidentiality, data are forwarded to Eurostat. The information collected in the FSS covered land use, livestock numbers, rural development, management and farm labour input (including the age, gender and relationship to the holder of the agricultural holding). The survey data can then be aggregated by different geographic levels (countries, regions, and for basic surveys also district level). The data can also be arranged by size class, area status, legal status of the holding, objective zone and farm type. The basic unit underlying the FSS is the agricultural holding. The FSS covered all agricultural holdings which meet the minimum requirements set in the applicable legislation, see also the article on Farm structure survey - thresholds. The legal basis for the FSS was Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 of 19 November 2008 on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods, which repealed Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88. The Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 on farm structure surveys ceased to provide statistical information as of 2018. It was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 2018/1091.   \n",
       "1  The standard output of an agricultural product (crop or livestock), abbreviated as SO, is the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare or per head of livestock. There is a regional SO coefficient for each product, as an average value over a reference period (5 years, except for the SO 2004 coefficient calculated using the average of 3 years). The sum of all the SO per hectare of crop and per head of livestock in a farm is a measure of its overall economic size, expressed in euro. The standard output is used to classify agricultural holdings by type of farming and by economic size. The common classification of holdings is built on different nested levels. Homogeneous groups of holdings can be assembled in a greater or lower degree of aggregation. Depending on the amount of details required, the types of farming are divided into : general types of farming (1 digit), principal types of farming (2 digits), particular types of farming (3 digits), in earlier years in a few cases split into subdivisions of particular types of farming (4 digits). Table 1 shows the changes in the classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming between the Farm structure surveys 1985 and 2016. Table 1: Classification of agricultural holdings by type of farming and by survey year Until 2007 the Farm structure survey (FSS ) and the Farm accountancy data network (FADN) have used standard gross margin (SGM) to classify agricultural holdings by type of farming and by economic size ( Commission Decision (EEC) No 377/1985 ). From FSS 2010 this classification uses standard output (SO) instead of SGM according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008, which is replaced by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014 for FSS 2016 and onwards. The principle of both concepts SGM and SO is the same; only the way they are calculated differs: SGM = Output + Direct Payments a Costs SO= Output The decision to leave SGM was driven by the CAP moving from coupled to decoupled payments. Since decoupled direct payments cannot be attributed to any specific production, they were excluded from the calculation. If the cost were kept in the calculation there would be the possibility of negative SGM values in cases where costs were higher that the output. Therefore only the output is taken into account. The main differences between SO and SGM are: SO excludes direct payments and includes the production costs; the fodder requirement in the case of some livestock characteristics is included in the calculation of the SO; the unit used to measure SO is the euro and not ESU (1200 Euro) as in the SGM classification.

It lists two kinds of primary income under 'resources': primary incomes already recorded in the generation of income account that are receivable by resident institutional units by virtue of their direct participation in the production process (mainly operating surplus and mixed income, compensation of employees) property incomes receivable by the owner of a financial asset or a tangible non-produced asset in return for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit ( interest, dividends, withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations, reinvested earnings of foreign direct investment, rents on land). Property income paid is recorded under 'uses'. The balancing item of the allocation of primary income account is called 'balance of primary income' for sectors and sub-sectors and 'national income' for the total economy. When the balancing item includes consumption of fixed capital (CFC), it is called 'gross balance of primary income' and ' gross national income (GNI) ', respectively. After deduction of CFC it is called 'net balance of primary income' and 'net national income (NNI)', respectively. The allocation of primary income account can be calculated only for the institutional sectors and their subsectors because, in the case of industries, it is impossible to break down certain flows connected with financing (capital loans and borrowings) and assets.   \n",

Its stated mission is to advance opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive employment in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. The ILO was founded in 1919, in the wake of World War I, to pursue a vision based on the premise that universal, lasting peace can only occur if based on the decent treatment of working women and men. In 1946 it became the UN's first specialised agency, with as main objectives to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue concerning work-related issues. The ILO is the global body responsible for drafting and overseeing international labour standards. Working with its Member States, the ILO seeks to ensure that labour standards are respected in practice, as well as in principle.   \n",

The data navigation tree is based on the nine statistical themes presented above and is collapsible and expandable. It has four main branches: Database by themes which contains the full range of public data available on Eurostatas website. These data are presented in multi-dimensional tables with selection features that allow tailor-made presentations and extractions. The interface for databases is called the Data browser and this provides an intuitive way to select and organise information. Data can be downloaded from the Data browser in various formats (XLS, CSV and TSV). Tables by themes which offers a selection of the most important Eurostat data in a user-friendly way. Techical aspects are the same as for \"Database by themes\". Tables on EU policy which also provides access to pre-defined main tables; these have particular relevance for tracking the progress being made in relation to important policy areas, including: the macroeconomic imbalances procedure indicators ; the euro-indicators / principal European economic indicators a PEEIs ; the Europe 2020 indicators; the circular economy indicators; the sustainable development indicators; the Employment and social policy indicators; and the indicators for the European pillar of social rights. The tools for viewing and extracting data are the same as those described above for tables by themes. The fourth branch was created to present some cross-cutting topics, and currently contains data coming from different data sources on the quality of life, migrant integration and children in migration, economic globalisation indicators, equality (age and gender), quality of employment, agri-environmental indicators, climate change and skills-related statistics. The data navigation tree also has two special branches, where new items or recently updated items (from all databases and main tables) can be displayed according to a number of criteria set by the user. Online data codes Eurostat online data codes, such as tps00001 and nama_gdp_c [1], allow easy access to the most recent data on Eurostatas website; these codes are given as part of the source below each table, figure or map. Users can access the freshest data by typing a standardised hyperlink into a web browser a https:/ /ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product' code=&lt;data_code&gt;&amp;mode=view a where &lt;data_code&gt; is to be replaced by the online data code printed under the table or figure in question.

Manuals and guidelines describe methodologies, guidelines and standards which are actually applied in the European Statistical System (ESS). Statistical working papers present on-going statistical methodological developments and applied statistical studies. Statistical reports are quality reports or other papers introducing new or experimental data in one statistical area. Compact guides are leaflets promoting a statistical domain. Statistics Explained Statistics Explained provides easy access to statistical information concerning the EU. It can be accessed from the homepage of the Eurostat website as well as from the right-hand frame of most dedicated sections. Statistics Explained is an online publishing system about EU statistics which uses MediaWiki technology and resembles Wikipedia. It is a collaborative platform that is used to present statistical articles which together form an encyclopaedia of European statistics, completed by a glossary of the statistical concepts and terms used. In addition, numerous links are provided to the latest data and metadata and to further information, making Statistics Explained a portal for regular and occasional users alike. Statistics Explained pages in English consists of some 700 statistical articles presenting data, 200 background articles on methodological practices or developments, and some 1900 glossary pages defining or explaining terms; these numbers are continuously growing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Metadata dissemination Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX) content oriented guidelines were adopted in January 2009 by seven international organisations: the Euro SDMX metadata structure (ESMS) is a format based on these. ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData &gt; Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Table 1 and Figure 5 show the breakdown of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport between national, international intra-EU and international extra-EU transport for each reporting country. Unlike the other statistics presented in this article, these figures do not reflect the sum of embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in ports, but estimate the transport of passengers between ports. As far as possible, double-counting of the same passengers being reported as embarking in one port and disembarking in another port within the same statistical aggregate is excluded in these figures (see data sources). At 220 million, the EU seaborne transport of passengers (excluding cruise passengers) remained stable between 2018 and 2019 (+0.1 %) (Table 1). Compared to the previous year, only five EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: the most noticeable being for Belgium (-6.3 %) and France (-4.8 %). The candidate country Montenegro registered a substantial fall of 10.2 %. In contrast, the main growths from 2018 to 2019 were recorded for Lithuania (+6.2 %) and Portugal (+6.0 %). The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial increase of 29.8 %. The majority of the seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in the EU is carried out between ports located in the same country (63 %), reflecting the dominant role of national ferry services in the EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport (Figure 5). In general, countries with busy ferry connections to and from well-populated islands will have both a large volume of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport and a high share of national maritime passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport. This applies to the two leading maritime passenger countries, Italy and Greece, as well as countries like Portugal, Croatia and Spain. Countries with ferry connections to other EU countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, naturally have high shares of international intra-EU transport. Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Spain recorded the highest shares of extra-EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in 2019, with Spain having ferry links with Morocco and the other countries with the United Kingdom.</td>\n",

The manufacturing sector employed 29.9 million persons in 2018 and generated EUR 1944 billion of value added. By these two measures, manufacturing was the second largest of the NACE sections within the EUas non-financial business economy in terms of its contribution to employment (23.1 %) and the largest contributor to non-financial business economy value added, accounting for more than one quarter of the total (29.7 %). In 2018, the EUas manufacturing sector recorded apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs above non-financial business economy averages: the apparent labour productivity of the manufacturing sector was EUR 65000 per person employed, some EUR 14300 more than the non-financial business economy average (EUR 50700 per person employed), while average personnel costs in the manufacturing sector were EUR 42800 per employee, some EUR 7300 above the non-financial business economy average (EUR 35500 per employee). Combining these two ratios into the wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio shows that value added per person employed in the EUas manufacturing sector was equivalent to 152.0 % of average personnel costs per employee, which was slightly above the average for the non-financial business economy (143.0 %). The gross operating rate (the relation between the gross operating surplus and turnover ) was 9.6 % for the EUas manufacturing sector in 2018, below the 10.2 % average for the non-financial business economy, and as such this sector had the second lowest level of profitability (using this measure) among any of the NACE sections within the non-financial business economy, with only distributive trades recording a lower gross operating rate (5.4 %).</td>\n",

The largest EU subsectors in 2018 in terms of value added were the manufacture of machinery and equipment (Division 28) and manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (Division 29), while in terms of employment manufacture of food products (Division 10) and the manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment (Division 25) were the largest a see Figure 1. Manufacturing subsectors are very diverse, combining activities with relatively low apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs, such as the manufacture of wearing apparel (Division 14), of leather and related products (Division 15), wood and of products of wood and cork (Division 16), furniture (Division 31), and textiles (Division 13), with other activities that have considerably higher values for the same indicators, such as manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations (Division 21), of coke and refined petroleum products (Division 19) and the manufacture of tobacco products (Division 12)nbsp;see Table 2b. In 2018, apparent labour productivity within the EUas manufacturing subsectors ranged from EUR 22000 per person employed or more for the manufacture of wearing apparel, to EUR 186000 per person employed for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations.In line with their very low apparent labour productivity, the manufacture of wearing apparel and of furniture recorded the lowest average personnel costs in the EUas manufacturing sector, at EUR 17800 per employee and EUR 26000 per employee respectively. Average personnel costs per employee were EUR 73000 per employee for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations, the highest among the manufacturing subsectors and second highest subsector within all of the non-financial economy subsectors. This subsector also recorded second highest apparent labour productivity among NACE divisions within the whole of the non-financial business economy and together with manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products recorded the highest wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio among manufacturing subsectors.On the other side, repair and installation of machinery and equipment (Division 33) recorded the lowest (117.0 %) a see Table 2b. An analysis of the EUas gross operating surplus (value added less personnel costs) gives an idea of the operating profit before depreciation charges. The highest gross operating surplus were recorded for the manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of beverages equivalent to 14.1 % and 13.9 % of turnover respectively. The remaining subsectors mainly recorded gross operating rates between 6.2 % for the manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30) and 11.6 % for the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (Division 23). The one exception was the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products which had a gross operating rate of 4.1 %, its low rate explained, in part, by the capital-intensive nature and relatively high turnover of this transformation activity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Because of the tradable (export and import) nature of manufactured goods it follows that the relative importance of manufacturing within the non-financial business economy varies greatly between EU Member States and also that specialisations at the subsector level are sometimes very pronounced. Figure 2 shows that the share of manufacturing within the non-financial business economyas value added varied in 2018 from 11.9 % in Luxembourg and 12.6 % in Cyprus to more than 37.0 % of the total in Slovakia and Czechia, with Ireland having the highest share (45.0 %). The range in employment terms was similar, from 11.9 % in the Netherlands to 35.1 % in Czechia. Among the five largest EU Member States, Germany stood out as its manufacturing sector contributed to one third (33.4 %) of the EUas value added in 2018, above its 28.3 % share of value added in the EUas non-financial business economy as a whole. Italy also recorded a larger share (12.7 %) of the value added generated in the EUas manufacturing sector than it did for the non-financial business economy as a whole (11.5 %), while the reverse was true for France, Spain and the Netherlands.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) contributed more to the EUas manufacturing sector than is typical for the non-financial business economy as a whole a in 2018, some 64.6 % of the manufacturing sectoras value added was generated by large enterprises and these employed 47.6 % of the manufacturing employment; for comparison, the non-financial business economy average for large enterprise was a 47.2 % share of value added and a 35.1 % share of the employment. The contribution of large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) to EU value added in 2018 was concentrated in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, tobacco products and of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. The contribution of medium-sized enterprises (employing 50 to 249 persons) to EU value added in 2018 was highest (across the manufacturing sector) in rubber and plastic products, textiles, leather and related products and fabricated metal products except machinery and equipment.In the manufacture of leather and related products, small enterprises (employing 10 to 49 persons) contributed 29.4 % of the subsectorsa value added. Micro enterprises (employing fewer than 10 persons) contributed to the largest share of value added among the four size classes in manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials (29.4 %) and repair and installation of machinery and equipment (28.1 %) a as shown in Figure 6.</td>\n",

The tools for viewing and extracting data are the same as those described above for tables by themes. The fourth branch was created to present some cross-cutting topics, and currently contains data coming from different data sources on the quality of life, migrant integration and children in migration, economic globalisation indicators, equality (age and gender), quality of employment, agri-environmental indicators, climate change and skills-related statistics. The data navigation tree also has two special branches, where new items or recently updated items (from all databases and main tables) can be displayed according to a number of criteria set by the user. Online data codes Eurostat online data codes, such as tps00001 and nama_gdp_c [1], allow easy access to the most recent data on Eurostatas website; these codes are given as part of the source below each table, figure or map. Users can access the freshest data by typing a standardised hyperlink into a web browser a https:/ /ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product' code=<data_code>&mode=view a where <data_code> is to be replaced by the online data code printed under the table or figure in question. The data are presented either in the TGM or the Data explorer interface. Online data codes can also be fed into the aSearcha function on Eurostatas website, which is presented in the top right-hand corner of most Eurostat webpages. The results from such a search present related dataset(s), publications, euro indicators, news articles, dedicated sections and other information. By clicking on these hyperlinks users are taken to the appropriate dedicated section or to product page(s). Note that the data on Eurostatas website are frequently updated. Visualisation tools Several data visualisation tools provide users with interactive web applications. They are available from the Eurostat website.  \n",

ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData > Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading.  \n",

Unlike the other statistics presented in this article, these figures do not reflect the sum of embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in ports, but estimate the transport of passengers between ports. As far as possible, double-counting of the same passengers being reported as embarking in one port and disembarking in another port within the same statistical aggregate is excluded in these figures (see data sources). At 220 million, the EU seaborne transport of passengers (excluding cruise passengers) remained stable between 2018 and 2019 (+0.1 %) (Table 1). Compared to the previous year, only five EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: the most noticeable being for Belgium (-6.3 %) and France (-4.8 %). The candidate country Montenegro registered a substantial fall of 10.2 %. In contrast, the main growths from 2018 to 2019 were recorded for Lithuania (+6.2 %) and Portugal (+6.0 %). The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial increase of 29.8 %. The majority of the seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in the EU is carried out between ports located in the same country (63 %), reflecting the dominant role of national ferry services in the EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport (Figure 5). In general, countries with busy ferry connections to and from well-populated islands will have both a large volume of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport and a high share of national maritime passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport. This applies to the two leading maritime passenger countries, Italy and Greece, as well as countries like Portugal, Croatia and Spain. Countries with ferry connections to other EU countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, naturally have high shares of international intra-EU transport. Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Spain recorded the highest shares of extra-EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in 2019, with Spain having ferry links with Morocco and the other countries with the United Kingdom.  \n",

The manufacturing sector employed 29.9 million persons in 2018 and generated EUR 1944 billion of value added. By these two measures, manufacturing was the second largest of the NACE sections within the EUas non-financial business economy in terms of its contribution to employment (23.1 %) and the largest contributor to non-financial business economy value added, accounting for more than one quarter of the total (29.7 %). In 2018, the EUas manufacturing sector recorded apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs above non-financial business economy averages: the apparent labour productivity of the manufacturing sector was EUR 65000 per person employed, some EUR 14300 more than the non-financial business economy average (EUR 50700 per person employed), while average personnel costs in the manufacturing sector were EUR 42800 per employee, some EUR 7300 above the non-financial business economy average (EUR 35500 per employee). Combining these two ratios into the wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio shows that value added per person employed in the EUas manufacturing sector was equivalent to 152.0 % of average personnel costs per employee, which was slightly above the average for the non-financial business economy (143.0 %). The gross operating rate (the relation between the gross operating surplus and turnover ) was 9.6 % for the EUas manufacturing sector in 2018, below the 10.2 % average for the non-financial business economy, and as such this sector had the second lowest level of profitability (using this measure) among any of the NACE sections within the non-financial business economy, with only distributive trades recording a lower gross operating rate (5.4 %).  \n",
       "3844                                                                                            At the NACE division level the manufacturing sector is composed of 24 different subsectors. The largest EU subsectors in 2018 in terms of value added were the manufacture of machinery and equipment (Division 28) and manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (Division 29), while in terms of employment manufacture of food products (Division 10) and the manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment (Division 25) were the largest a see Figure 1. Manufacturing subsectors are very diverse, combining activities with relatively low apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs, such as the manufacture of wearing apparel (Division 14), of leather and related products (Division 15), wood and of products of wood and cork (Division 16), furniture (Division 31), and textiles (Division 13), with other activities that have considerably higher values for the same indicators, such as manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations (Division 21), of coke and refined petroleum products (Division 19) and the manufacture of tobacco products (Division 12)nbsp;see Table 2b. In 2018, apparent labour productivity within the EUas manufacturing subsectors ranged from EUR 22000 per person employed or more for the manufacture of wearing apparel, to EUR 186000 per person employed for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations.In line with their very low apparent labour productivity, the manufacture of wearing apparel and of furniture recorded the lowest average personnel costs in the EUas manufacturing sector, at EUR 17800 per employee and EUR 26000 per employee respectively. Average personnel costs per employee were EUR 73000 per employee for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations, the highest among the manufacturing subsectors and second highest subsector within all of the non-financial economy subsectors. This subsector also recorded second highest apparent labour productivity among NACE divisions within the whole of the non-financial business economy and together with manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products recorded the highest wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio among manufacturing subsectors.On the other side, repair and installation of machinery and equipment (Division 33) recorded the lowest (117.0 %) a see Table 2b. An analysis of the EUas gross operating surplus (value added less personnel costs) gives an idea of the operating profit before depreciation charges. The highest gross operating surplus were recorded for the manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of beverages equivalent to 14.1 % and 13.9 % of turnover respectively. The remaining subsectors mainly recorded gross operating rates between 6.2 % for the manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30) and 11.6 % for the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (Division 23). The one exception was the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products which had a gross operating rate of 4.1 %, its low rate explained, in part, by the capital-intensive nature and relatively high turnover of this transformation activity.  \n",

Figure 2 shows that the share of manufacturing within the non-financial business economyas value added varied in 2018 from 11.9 % in Luxembourg and 12.6 % in Cyprus to more than 37.0 % of the total in Slovakia and Czechia, with Ireland having the highest share (45.0 %). The range in employment terms was similar, from 11.9 % in the Netherlands to 35.1 % in Czechia. Among the five largest EU Member States, Germany stood out as its manufacturing sector contributed to one third (33.4 %) of the EUas value added in 2018, above its 28.3 % share of value added in the EUas non-financial business economy as a whole. Italy also recorded a larger share (12.7 %) of the value added generated in the EUas manufacturing sector than it did for the non-financial business economy as a whole (11.5 %), while the reverse was true for France, Spain and the Netherlands.  \n",

The contribution of large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) to EU value added in 2018 was concentrated in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, tobacco products and of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. The contribution of medium-sized enterprises (employing 50 to 249 persons) to EU value added in 2018 was highest (across the manufacturing sector) in rubber and plastic products, textiles, leather and related products and fabricated metal products except machinery and equipment.In the manufacture of leather and related products, small enterprises (employing 10 to 49 persons) contributed 29.4 % of the subsectorsa value added. Micro enterprises (employing fewer than 10 persons) contributed to the largest share of value added among the four size classes in manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials (29.4 %) and repair and installation of machinery and equipment (28.1 %) a as shown in Figure 6.  \n",

General and regional statistics; Economy and finance; Population and social conditions; Industry, trade and services; Agriculture and fisheries; International trade; Transport; Environment and energy; Science, technology and digital society. For each of these themes, the user is presented with a range of different subthemes. These subthemes are presented through adedicated sectionsa on each subject area, with links to information for data (main tables and databases), legislation, methodology, publications and other background information. Access to data Data navigation tree The majority of Eurostatas statistics may be accessed from the data navigation tree ; alternatively, click on aData &gt; Databasea in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. The data navigation tree is based on the nine statistical themes presented above and is collapsible and expandable. It has four main branches: Database by themes which contains the full range of public data available on Eurostatas website. These data are presented in multi-dimensional tables with selection features that allow tailor-made presentations and extractions. The interface for databases is called the Data browser and this provides an intuitive way to select and organise information. Data can be downloaded from the Data browser in various formats (XLS, CSV and TSV). Tables by themes which offers a selection of the most important Eurostat data in a user-friendly way. Techical aspects are the same as for \"Database by themes\". Tables on EU policy which also provides access to pre-defined main tables; these have particular relevance for tracking the progress being made in relation to important policy areas, including: the macroeconomic imbalances procedure indicators ; the euro-indicators / principal European economic indicators a PEEIs ; the Europe 2020 indicators; the circular economy indicators; the sustainable development indicators; the Employment and social policy indicators; and the indicators for the European pillar of social rights. The tools for viewing and extracting data are the same as those described above for tables by themes. The fourth branch was created to present some cross-cutting topics, and currently contains data coming from different data sources on the quality of life, migrant integration and children in migration, economic globalisation indicators, equality (age and gender), quality of employment, agri-environmental indicators, climate change and skills-related statistics. The data navigation tree also has two special branches, where new items or recently updated items (from all databases and main tables) can be displayed according to a number of criteria set by the user. Online data codes Eurostat online data codes, such as tps00001 and nama_gdp_c [1], allow easy access to the most recent data on Eurostatas website; these codes are given as part of the source below each table, figure or map. Users can access the freshest data by typing a standardised hyperlink into a web browser a https:/ /ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product' code=&lt;data_code&gt;&amp;mode=view a where &lt;data_code&gt; is to be replaced by the online data code printed under the table or figure in question. The data are presented either in the TGM or the Data explorer interface. Online data codes can also be fed into the aSearcha function on Eurostatas website, which is presented in the top right-hand corner of most Eurostat webpages. The results from such a search present related dataset(s), publications, euro indicators, news articles, dedicated sections and other information. By clicking on these hyperlinks users are taken to the appropriate dedicated section or to product page(s). Note that the data on Eurostatas website are frequently updated. Visualisation tools Several data visualisation tools provide users with interactive web applications. They are available from the Eurostat website. Publications Eurostat produces a variety of publications. All publications are available free-of-charge in from Eurostatas website. A a Publications a tab is accessible from the top menu bar on Eurostatas website. Eurostatas publications programme consists of several collections: Flagship publications (paper or digital) addressing themes highly relevant for stakeholder. Examples are the Eurostat Regional yearbook and The EU in the World. Interactive publications are digital publications containing short texts, dynamic infographics, maps, videos, graphs, photos, etc. Examples are Housing in Europe and Regions in Europe - statistics visualised. Key figures is a series of publications providing short texts and static visulisations giving an overview of a subject. Examples are Key figures on Europe and Key figures on European business. Manuals and guidelines describe methodologies, guidelines and standards which are actually applied in the European Statistical System (ESS). Statistical working papers present on-going statistical methodological developments and applied statistical studies. Statistical reports are quality reports or other papers introducing new or experimental data in one statistical area. Compact guides are leaflets promoting a statistical domain. Statistics Explained Statistics Explained provides easy access to statistical information concerning the EU. It can be accessed from the homepage of the Eurostat website as well as from the right-hand frame of most dedicated sections. Statistics Explained is an online publishing system about EU statistics which uses MediaWiki technology and resembles Wikipedia. It is a collaborative platform that is used to present statistical articles which together form an encyclopaedia of European statistics, completed by a glossary of the statistical concepts and terms used. In addition, numerous links are provided to the latest data and metadata and to further information, making Statistics Explained a portal for regular and occasional users alike. Statistics Explained pages in English consists of some 700 statistical articles presenting data, 200 background articles on methodological practices or developments, and some 1900 glossary pages defining or explaining terms; these numbers are continuously growing. Reference metadata Metadata dissemination Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX) content oriented guidelines were adopted in January 2009 by seven international organisations: the Euro SDMX metadata structure (ESMS) is a format based on these. ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData &gt; Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading. User support Eurostat and the other members of the ESS have set up a system of user support centres. These exist for nearly all of the EUas official languages and for a range of languages spoken in the EFTA, candidate countries and potential candidates. In order to offer the best possible and personalised support, requests should, whenever possible, be addressed to the relevant language support centre. The mission of each centre is to provide free-of-charge help and guidance to persons having difficulty in finding the statistical data they require. Contact information for these user support centres is available via the a Help a tab on Eurostatas website.

       "      <td>Introduction The AES provides an overview of the participation of individuals in education and training (i.e. formal and non-formal education and training as well as informal learning). The reference period for the participation in the learning activities is the twelve months prior to the interview. The survey focuses on people aged 25-64. A pilot survey took place around the year 2007 and starting from the 2011 survey the AES is carried out every five years. The following information is available from the AES: Participation in formal education, non-formal education and training and informal learning (respectively labelled FE, NFE and INF); Access to information on learning possibilities; Time spent on education and training; Characteristics of the learning activities; Reasons for not participating; Obstacles to participation; Employer financing and costs of learning; Self-reported language skills. Comparable data from 2007, 2011 and 2016 AES can be found in the following folders of the database: Participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m0); Participation in informal learning (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m4); Access to information on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m1); Time spent on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m2); Obstacles to participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m3); Self-reported language skills (educ_lang_00). Coverage and mandate Three waves of the AES have been implemented so far. The first AES (2007 AES) was a pilot survey conducted in 26 EU Member States (Ireland and Luxembourg did not participate), as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Tukey. This first wave was carried out based on a gentlemenas agreement between 2005 and 2008 (depending on the country). The second wave (2011 AES) was conducted in 27 EU Member States (Croatia did not participate), Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia and Turkey between July 2011 and June 2012. This statistical operation was for the first time conducted under the institutional mandate set in Regulation 452/2008, and implemented by Regulation 823/2010. This legal basis establishes the collection of data on the participation of adults (aged 25a64) in learning activities every five years. The third wave (2016 AES) was conducted in 28 EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between July 2016 and March 2017. Regulation 1175/2014 provided the implementation details of this wave. Further information on each wave is available in the reference metadata and in the implementation manuals. Basic concepts Lifelong learning encompasses all learning activities undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences, within personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or aim to learn is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sporting activities. Adult learning means the participation of adults in lifelong learning. Adult learning usually refers to learning activities after the end of initial education. The participation rate in education and training covers participation in both formal and non-formal education and training. Learning activities are any activities of an individual organised with the intention to improve their knowledge, skills, and competences. There are two fundamental criteria that distinguish learning activities from non-learning activities: they must be intentional and organised. Intentional learning (as opposed to random learning) is defined as a deliberate search for knowledge, skills or competences or attitudes of lasting value. Organised learning is defined as learning planned in a pattern or sequence with explicit or implicit aims. The learning activities are defined within a classification named classification of learning activities (CLA). The current version of the CLA (2016 edition) is aligned with ISCED 2011. The 2016 edition of the CLA applies to the 2016 AES. 2007 and 2011 AES refer to the 2006 edition of the CLA; however, data between the waves are overall comparable. The CLA defines three main types of learning activities as follows: Formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned through public organisations and recognised private bodies, and - in their totality - constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education or equivalent authorities, e.g. any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub-national education authorities. Formal education consists mostly of initial education [...]. Vocational education, special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system. Qualifications from formal education are by definition recognised and, therefore, are within the scope of ISCED. Institutionalised education occurs when an organisation provides structured educational arrangements, such as student-teacher relationships and/or interactions, that are specially designed for education and learninga. [1] Non-formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided in order to guarantee the right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a continuous pathway structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity; and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Nevertheless, formal, recognised qualifications may be obtained through exclusive participation in specific non-formal education programmes; this often happens when the non-formal programme completes the competencies obtained in another contexta. [2] Informal learning is aintentional, but it is less organised and less structured... and may include for example learning events (activities) that occur in the family, in the workplace, and in the daily life of every person, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis.a [3] Job-related non-formal education and training : the respondent takes part in the non-formal education and training activity in order to obtain knowledge and/or learn new skills needed for a current or future job, to increase earnings, to improve job and/or career opportunities in a current or another field and generally to improve his/her opportunities for advancement and promotion. Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal education and training : all job-related non-formal education and training activities paid at least partially by the employer and/or done during paid working hours. Usual breakdowns and classifications Educational attainment level Educational attainment level is the highest level of education successfully completed by an individual. Educational attainment is classified according to the International standard classification of education (ISCED). This classification allows for international comparability between the different national education systems, introducing criteria to categorise the education levels into a common nomenclature. It therefore facilitates comparisons across countries based on uniform and internationally agreed definitions. The successful completion of an education programme must be validated by a recognised qualification, i.e. a qualification officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance. When determining the highest level, both general and vocational education should be taken into consideration. 2016 AES was classified according to ISCED 2011; 2007 and 2011 AES were classified under ISCED 1997. The AES data dissemination considers three broad levels of aggregation: Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education (levels 0 to 2 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 0, 1 and 2 but also include level 3C short (educational attainment from ISCED level 3 programmes of less than two years); Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (levels 3 and 4 of ISCED 2011). ISCED 2011 level 3 programmes of partial level completion are considered within ISCED level 3. Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 3C long, 3A, 3B and 4; Tertiary education (levels 5 to 8 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 5 and 6. Occupation Occupation is defined as the task and duties undertaken by each worker in their job. The International standard classification of occupations (ISCO) organises jobs into a clearly defined set of groups. 2011 and 2016 AES were classified according to ISCO-08; 2007 AES was classified under ISCO-COM 88. Data are directly comparable for the categories shown online. Four categories of employee occupations are distinguished in the online tables on occupation: Managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals; Clerical support workers, service and sales workers; Skilled manual workers; and Elementary occupations. Foreign languages - level of self-reported knowledge The knowledge of foreign languages is self-reported by the respondents and is categorised in three levels in the 2011 AES questionnaire. The labels displayed in the online tables of domain educ_lang_00 correspond to the following self-reported knowledge: Fair : I can understand and use the most common everyday expressions. I use the language in relation to familiar things and situations; Good : I can understand the essential of clear language and produce simple text. I can describe experiences and events and communicate fairly fluently; and Proficient : I can understand a wide range of demanding texts and use the language flexibly. I master the language almost completely. In the 2007 and 2016 AES, a fourth a basic a level was included in the questionnaire: aI only understand and can use a few wordsa. In the online tables that fourth category is included in the category a fair a. Degree of urbanisation Three types of areas are defined based on population density: cities : at least 50% of the population lives in urban centres; towns and suburbs : at least 50% of the population lives in urban clusters and less than 50% of the population lives in urban centres; rural areas : at least 50% of the population lives in rural grid cells. Questionnaire The 2016 AES European standard questionnaire has the following structure: 1.0 - General information 1.1 - Information on the household 1.2 - Information on the individual 1.3 - Access to information about learning possibilities 1.4 - Participation in education and training 1.5 - Difficulties in participation in education 1.6 - Informal learning 1.7 - Languages 1.8 - Household income National questionnaires a which are based on the standard questionnaire for the sake of cross-country comparability a are available on this link.

       "      <td>Participation rate of adults in learning in the last four weeks The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training adopted in May 2009 had set a number of benchmarks to be achieved by 2020, including one for adult participation in learning, namely that an average of at least 15 % of adults aged 25 to 64 years old should participate in lifelong learning. In 2020, the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 in the EU who participated in education or training was 9.2 %; a share that was 0.9 percentage points lower than the corresponding share for 2015 and 1.6 points lower compared to 2019. It is considered that part of the decrease could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. cancellation of training activities. The adult learning indicator refers to participation in formal and non-formal education and training and the reference period for the participation is the four weeks preceding the interview as is usual in the labour force survey. (see Table 1). Denmark, Finland and Sweden stood out from the other EU Member States as they reported considerably higher proportions of their respective adult populations participating in lifelong learning in the four weeks preceding the interview, ranging from 20.0 % to 28.6 %. Estonia, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were the only other Member States where the participation rate in 2020 exceeded the 15 % benchmark. By contrast, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia and Poland reported adult learning rates of less than 4.0 %. The proportion of the population who had participated in adult learning was higher among women (10.0 % in 2020) in the EU than among men (8.3 %); the shares for men and women were both lower in 2020 than they had been five years earlier. The participation rate of both women and men increased continuously until 2019 and fell in 2020 only, i.e. with the onset of the COVID-2019 pandemic. In 2020, women recorded higher participation rates than men in all EU Member States except for Czechia, Germany, Greece and Cyprus (where rates for men were higher), while Romania reported the same rate for both sexes. The largest gender difference, in percentage points, was in Sweden, where the participation rate for women was 13.6 percentage points higher than for men. Participation rate of adults in learning in the last 12 months In addition to the data from the labour force survey which provides information on participation in education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey interview, information on education and training is available from the adult education survey (AES). The AES measures participation in learning activities with a longer reference period (12 months preceding the survey interview) and therefore is likely to cover more learning activities, resulting in higher participation rates in formal and non-formal education and training. However, it is carried out less frequently (from 2016 every six years). The most recent wave of the survey was conducted between July 2016 and March 2017 (and named the 2016 AES). According to this survey, in 201643.7 % of people in the EU aged 25 to 64 took part in education and training (during the 12 months preceding the interview), the majority of which participating in non-formal education and training (see Figure 1). For the EU as a whole, participation rates in education and training in the 12 months preceding the interview were almost the same for men and women. In Cyprus, Czechia, Hungary and Italy, men were considerably more likely than women to have participated in education and training, whereas the reverse was true in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Lithuania (see Table 2). An analysis by age shows that the participation of younger persons (aged 25a34) in the EU was more than 20 percentage points higher than that of older ones (aged 55a64) in 2016. Participation in education and training among older persons was particularly low in Romania and Greece. The likelihood of participation in education and training was related to the level of educational achievement: persons with a tertiary level education reported the highest participation rates (64.5 % for the EU in 2016), while those having completed at most lower secondary education were the least likely to have participated (22.9 %). Providers of non-formal education and training activities Employers were the most common providers of non-formal education and training activities, providing more than one third (33.7 %) of such activities in the EU according to the 2016 adult education survey (see Table 3). Employers provided almost two thirds of non-formal education and training in Bulgaria, and three fifths of such activities in Hungary. Among the less common providers of non-formal education and training in the EU as a whole, the relative importance of non-formal education and training institutions was particularly high in Poland (48.7 %) and Slovenia (36.7 %), formal education institutions were frequent providers in Lithuania and Finland, and commercial institutions (where education and training is not the main activity) in Sweden (see Table 3). Participation in informal learning activities Next to information on participation in formal and non-formal education and training, the adult education survey also collects information on informal learning. Typical forms of informal learning are taught learning via coaching or guided visits to e.g. museums. Informal learning can also take place as non-taught learning, e.g. as self-learning or as learning in a group with friends or colleagues. In 2016, 59.7 % of adults aged 25-64 in the EU reported participation in any informal learning in the 12 months preceding the interview (see Table 4). Participation in informal learning ranged from below 35 % in Lithuania and Poland to over 90 % in Croatia and Cyprus. In the majority of countries women were more likely than men to participate in this type of learning. Not very surprisingly, informal learning by using a computer (or similar devices) is reported to be the most frequent form of informal learning in most countries.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Formal and non-formal adult education and training About 44 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in some form of education or training Among adults of working age (25a64), 43.7 % across the EU took part in formal or non-formal education or training in 2016. This marked an increase of 3.5 percentage points compared with the previous survey, which was conducted in 2011, when 40.2 % of the working-age population had participated in formal or non-formal education or training. In 2007, this share was 32.8 %. In 2016, the majority of the non-formal education and training that was undertaken in the EU by people aged 25a64 was job-related rather than for personal fulfilment. Training courses, seminars, conferences and guided-on-the-job training are key elements for providing job-related training; while the latter type is usually very short, the other types tend to be of a slightly longer duration (typically one or two days). Guided-on-the-job training is characterised by planned periods of training, instruction or practical experience, using normal tools of work, either at the immediate place of work or in the work-situation with the presence of a tutor. In the Netherlands and Sweden, the share of the working-age population participating in education and training rose to 64 % Among the EU Member States, there was a considerable variation between the shares of adult working-age populations who participated in formal and non-formal education or training. In 2016, the highest proportions were recorded in the Netherlands (64.1 %) and Sweden (63.8 %), while 50a60 % of working-age adults in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Finland, Hungary and Austria participated in some form of education and training. A small majority, 16 of the Member States recorded participation rates between 25 and 50 %, while Greece (16.7 %) and Romania (7.0 %) recorded much lower participation rates (see Figure 1). Adult education and training by field of study An analysis of the instruction hours spent by field of study reveals that in 2016 less than one fifth (17.5 %) of the formal and non-formal education and training that was given to adults aged 25a64 in the EU concerned business, administration and law. There were two fields of study which each accounted for around 15 % of the total hours spent by adults in instruction: services; and health and welfare. Arts and humanities; and engineering, manufacturing and construction were the only other fields to record double-digit shares. Business, administration &amp; law and health &amp; welfare accounted for the biggest shares of adult education and training Table 1 highlights that, while business, administration and law was the most popular field of study in terms of hours spent for adult education and training in the EU in 2016, with eight Member States recording their highest shares in this domain, health and welfare was just behind with seven Member States. Among the other Member States, five recorded highest shares in services, four in arts and humanities and two in engineering, manufacturing and construction (Estonia registering its highest share in both health &amp; welfare and engineering, manufacturing and construction). The remaining two countries recorded high non response. Adult education and training: relative importance of formal and non-formal instruction Non-formal instruction is the most frequent type of education and training The majority of adult education and training in the EU is non-formal education and training, in other words, outside of formal institutions of schools, colleges and universities. This is not surprising given that the age criterion for the AES is persons of working age (25a64 years-old), when most people have already completed their formal studies. In 2016, more than two fifths (41.4 %) of the EUas adult working-age population participated in non-formal education and training, a share that was more than eight times as high as the share of those who participated in formal education or training (5.0 %). Formal education and training was relatively common in Finland (14.2 % of working-age adults), Sweden (13.8 %) and Denmark (13.5 %); all of the remaining EU Member States reported single-digit shares. By contrast, fewer than 3 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in formal education and training in Bulgaria, Czechia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia (see Figure 1). A higher proportion of the instruction given in health and welfare was provided in a formal setting, while the opposite was true for services Figure 3 provides an analysis of the relative importance of different fields of study in terms of instruction hours, contrasting formal and non-formal education and training. In 2016, health and welfare accounted for 18.8 % of the total number of hours adults spent in formal education and training in the EU compared with 11.5 % of hours spent in non-formal education and training. Engineering, manufacturing and construction accounted also for a considerably higher proportion of the formal instruction hours of adults in the EU in 2016 (when compared with its share of non-formal instruction hours), while the relative share of services in non-formal instruction hours was considerably higher than its share in formal instruction hours. In a similar vein, social sciences, journalism and information as well as natural sciences, mathematics and statistics accounted for a relatively high share of the total number of hours of formal instruction that were given to adults, while arts and humanities, Information and Communication Technologies and generic programmes and qualifications accounted for relatively high shares of the total number of hours of non-formal education and training. Focus on non-formal adult education and training The remainder of this article concentrates on the most common type of adult learning, non-formal education and training. The AES provides information on basically all non-formal learning activities in which an adult participated during the last 12 months. Therefore it is possible to analyse at the level of non-formal activities. The shares presented in this section are generally shown in relation to the total number of non-formal activities. Formal education and training of adults is not covered hereafter. Relative importance of job-related non-formal adult education and training In 2016, approximately four fifths (78.8 %) of the non-formal education and training activities of adults in the EU were job-related and almost one fifth (19.4 %) was not job-related; the remaining 1.8 % concerned non-formal activities where there was no response whether it was job-related or not. The share of non-formal learning activities that was job-related ranged among the EU Member States from highs of more than 90 % in Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, down to 55.6 % in Hungary (see Table 2). A higher proportion of non-formal learning activities of adult men rather than adult women was job-related Within the EU in 2016, a high proportion (83.2 %) of non-formal learning activities of men was job-related. This share could be compared with the corresponding value for women, where just below three quarters (74.6 %) of all non-formal learning activities were job-related. This gender gap was apparent in 26 EU Member States. The only exception was Cyprus, where the share of job-related non-formal learning activities was higher for women than for men: 79.3 % against 66.3 %. In contrast, while 90.5 % of the non-formal learning activities of men in Greece were job-related, the corresponding share for women was 17.0 percentage points lower. This was the largest gender gap among the EU Member States, ahead of Italy (14.8 points difference), while France, Czechia and Malta all reported double-digit differences (again with a higher share of non-formal learning activities of adult men being job-related). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to become slightly higher as people moved towards the 45a54 years age group In 2016, the share of non-formal learning activities in the EU that was job-related rose slightly as a function of age from 77.3 % for those aged 25a34 to a peak of 81.7 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 71.8 % among those aged 55a64. While considerably more than half of the non-formal learning of people aged 55a64 continued to be job-related, the relatively low shares for this age group suggest that some older persons were preparing for retirement by expanding their knowledge or skills in non-job related areas (see Figure 4). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to be higher among adults with a tertiary level of educational attainment An analysis by level of educational attainment (see Figure 4) suggests that adults in the EU with a tertiary level of educational attainment were more likely to follow some form of job-related education and training. In 2016, some 79.8 % of the non-formal learning activities of people aged 25a64 with a tertiary level of educational attainment (ISCED 2011 levels 5 to 8) were job-related, compared with 74.1 % among those with a low level of educational attainment (ISCED levels 0-2). At the same time, for adults with an intermediate educational attainment (ISCED levels 3-4) a share almost as high as for those with a tertiary education can be observed (78.6 %). Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal adult education and training Figure 5 shows the relative contribution of sponsorship from employers to job-related non-formal education and training. In 2016, some 68.4 % of the non-formal education and training activities of adults were job-related and sponsored by employers, while 10.4 % of the activities were job-related and financially supported by other means. With almost four fifths of all non-formal learning activities of adults in the EU being work-related, it is perhaps unsurprising to find that the vast majority of this was sponsored by employers providing financial support to their workforce in the form of training designed to improve the knowledge of their staff. The relatively high shares of education and training that are sponsored by employers may also be linked to the general affordability of training, which may be prohibitive for many people on an individual basis. A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by men were job-related and sponsored by employers A more detailed examination of these figures shows that employers provided financial support more often to male (rather than female) employees in order to follow job-related non-formal instruction. Almost three quarters (73.5 %) of the non-formal education and training activities followed by adult men in the EU were job-related and sponsored by employers, while among adult women the share was less than two thirds (63.5 %) a see Figure 5. Note these shares also reflect the lower proportion of women (than men) who participate in job-related non-formal education and training, which may, at least in part, be linked to lower employment rates among women; the EU employment rate for women aged 25a64 was 66.2 % in 2016, compared with a rate of 78.5 % for men of the same age. The share of non-formal training activities followed by adults that were both job-related and sponsored by employers peaked at 92.8 % in Bulgaria and 84.7 % in Slovakia, reflecting their high shares of overall job-related non-formal education and training. In contrast, less than half of the non-formal instruction was both job-related and sponsored by employers in Hungary (48.2 %) and Greece (34.8 %). The largest gender gaps for the share of adult non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers were recorded in Czechia and Italy, where the share for men was 15.0 and 14.3 percentage points higher than that for women. The gender gap was between 12.0 and 14.0 points (again in favour of men) in France, Latvia and Malta; even larger differences between the sexes were recorded in Turkey (24.8 percentage points). A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by those aged 45a54 were job-related and sponsored by employers Across the EU in 2016, some 64.8 % of the non-formal learning activities followed by adults aged 25a34 were job-related and sponsored by employers (see Figure 5). This share rose to 71.3 % among those aged 35a44 and 72.2 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 62.7 % for those aged 55a64. Note these figures reflect, to some degree, the relatively high proportion of non-formal education and training that was job-related among people aged 45a54. The initial increase with age may, at least in part, reflect the interest of employers and employees in keeping skills up-to-date, with this interest dropping off as employees get closer to the end of their working lives. While the share of job-related non-formal education and training activities that were financed by employers rose as a function of age up to the 45a54 age group for the EU as a whole, there was a mixed picture among the EU Member States (see Table 3). In 2016, there were 13 Member States where the highest share of non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers was recorded among those aged 45a54. There were 10 Member States where the highest share was recorded for those aged 35a44 and five where the highest share was for those aged 55a64 (Bulgaria recorded the highest share for both 45-54 and 55-64). In the absence of employer sponsorship, young adults were the most likely to undertake job-related education and training In 2016, the share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related but not sponsored by employers fell as a function of age (see Figure 5). This suggests that younger persons (25a34) were the most likely to undertake job-related non-formal instruction without employer sponsorship, while older persons (55a64) were the least likely (perhaps due to a shorter time horizon to benefit from any job-related education and training). A similar analysis by educational attainment level (see Figure 5 and Table 3) shows that in 2016 a relatively high proportion (68.2 %) of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken in the EU by those with a tertiary level of education was job-related and sponsored by employers. An even higher share (69.9 %) was recorded for those with an intermediate educational attainment, whereas the share recorded among those with a low level of educational attainment was lower, at 62.9 %. Job-related non-formal instruction by field of study Within the EU in 2016, more than one fifth (22.6 %) of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within the field of business, administration and law. There were three other fields of study which accounted for double-digit shares: services (19.5 %), health and welfare (14.2 %) and Information and Communication Technologies (10.6 %) (see Figure 6). In 2016, across 17 of the EU Member States, more than one fifth of the non-formal job-related instruction was within the field of business, administration and law. This share peaked at 32.5 % in Sweden and was followed by Germany (28.5 %) and Cyprus (27.5 %) (see Table 4). More than one fifth of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within services in eight of the EU Member States. This included Spain, with a share that was just above 20 %, while almost one third (32.9 %) of the non-formal job-related instruction in Hungary was in the field of services, a share that rose to around two fifths in Bulgaria (38.5 %) and Slovakia (43.5 %). There was also more than one fifth of job-related non-formal instruction of adults given over to health and welfare in Malta and Ireland. Another 21 EU Member States recorded shares that were in double-digits, and only Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary reported shares below 10 %.</td>\n",

High nature value farmland is therefore a key indicator for the assessment of the impact of policy interventions with respect to the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems dependent on agriculture and of traditional rural landscapes. As environmental objectives become increasingly important for the Common agricultural policy (CAP) and with increasing pressure on resources, complementarity and convergence between the agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) and the monitoring and evaluation framework being developed for the CAP is being sought wherever possible. Assessment A wide variety of approaches and combinations of methods are currently being used across the EU to assess the extent of HNV farmland. Whilst good progress has been made in assessing the extent of HNV farmland, the assessment of its condition or quality still presents a considerable challenge. Due to the variation in data availability across the EU Member States and regions of the EU and the range of physical situations (territory size, farm structure and systems, predominant land and habitat types), it is not appropriate to impose a common methodology for the assessment of HNV farmland. Use of one single method would restrict the analysis to data available throughout the EU, which would exclude the richest and most relevant data sources, and preclude those Member States which have developed more refined methods from using them, with a consequent reduction in the quality and accuracy of the assessment. Agreement on the common parameters being measured, and transparency and acceptance of the various methodologies, does allow for comparability and aggregation, provided that methodology appropriate to identifying land fulfilling the criteria for one of the three HNV types in that biophysical situation is used. It is however important that in each territory the same methodology is used for successive assessments, so that trends can be correctly estimated. AEI 23 - High nature value farmland is proposed as one of the impact indicators to be included in the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework for 2014-2020. As such it will fall under the provisions of Article 110 of the proposed CAP Horizontal Regulation ( Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 ), associated implementing rules, and the legislative framework for rural development. EU Member States will therefore be required to supply values for this indicator (a baseline situation, plus updates at specific points during the period) in the context of the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework. In particular it will be needed for the baseline description of each Rural Development Programme (RDP) territory, and the subsequent evaluation of RDPs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Poverty and deprivation There are two principal measures of poverty. Relative poverty concerns the situation where people whose income and/or resources prevent them from enjoying a anormala standard of living for the society in which they live. By contrast, absolute poverty is the deprivation of basic human needs, for example, a lack of food, water, sanitation facilities, health or education. Based on the above definitions, the most common form of poverty in the EU is relative poverty. People at risk of poverty or social exclusion The risk of poverty or social exclusion is a broader concept than just the risk of poverty. It does not depend exclusively on a householdas level of income, as it may also be a reflection of deprivation or joblessness. The number/share of people at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion combines three separate criteria covering people who are in at least one of the following situations: at-risk-of-poverty a people with a median equivalised disposable income (after social transfers ) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold ; suffering from severe material deprivation a people unable to afford at least four out of nine material items that are considered by most to be desirable (or even necessary) for having an adequate quality of life; living in a household with very low work intensity a where working-age adults worked no more than 20 % of their total potential during the previous 12 months. In 2018, more than one fifth of the EU-27 population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU-27 climbed to reach a peak of 108.7 million people in 2012. There followed six consecutive annual reductions, as the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion fell to 94.8 million by 2018; this latest figure was equivalent to 21.6 % of the EU-27 population. Map 1 shows the regional distribution of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion across NUTS level 2 regions. Note that the statistics presented for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, France and Portugal. The share of the population that was at risk of poverty or social exclusion was skewed, as approximately three fifths of all regions in the EU (114 out of the 187 for which data are available) recorded a share below the EU-27 average. At the bottom end of the distribution, only four regions reported less than 10 % of their population being at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2018: three Czech regions in Bohemia (including the capital region, Praha) and the Slovakian capital region of BratislavskA12 kraj. While some of the lowest risks of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in predominantly urban regions of eastern EU Member States, this was often in stark contrast to the situation in more rural regions. In 2018, there were 10 regions situated in eastern and southern EU Member States where more than 40 % of the population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion (as shown by the darkest shade in the map); these regions were situated in Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Spain and Italy. The highest risk of poverty or social exclusion was recorded in two southern Italian regions a Campania (53.6 %) and Sicilia (51.6 %). At-risk-of-poverty rate The European social model is based on offering protection to those who are most in need. When comparing at-risk-of-poverty rates before and after social transfers it is possible to make an assessment of the impact of welfare systems. In 2018, some 25.0 % of the EU-27 population was exposed to monetary poverty, with this proportion falling to 16.8 % after social transfers. Note that at-risk-of-poverty rates do not measure (a lack of) income in itself, rather they provide information on the share of the population with a level of income that is below a set threshold; this does not necessarily imply a low overall standard of living. In 2018, Czechia, Denmark, Slovenia and Finland were the only multi-regional EU Member States to report that every region had an at-risk-of-poverty rate (after social transfers) that was below the EU-27 average (see Map 2). Note that the statistics presented for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. The lowest at-risk-of-poverty rates were recorded in capital regions of eastern EU Member States Looking in more detail, people living in the capital regions of many eastern and some southern EU Member States were less likely to be at risk of poverty than their rural populations. The Romanian capital region of BucureAti - Ilfov had the lowest risk of poverty (4.1 %) among NUTS level 2 regions in 2018 and was followed by three more capital regions a BratislavskA12 kraj (4.3 %), Praha (6.0 %) and Helsinki-Uusimaa (6.9 %). By contrast, the opposite pattern was apparent in several western Member States. Despite their capital regions (and other large cities) often being among the most affluent regions in the EU, they were often characterised by pockets of social deprivation in specific neighbourhoods. For example, more than one fifth (21.3 %; 2017 data) of the population in the Austrian capital region of Wien was at risk of poverty, a higher share than in any other region of Austria. A similar pattern was apparent in Denmark, as the highest risk of poverty was recorded in the capital region of Hovedstaden (15.2 % in 2018). Some of the highest at-risk-of-poverty rates were recorded in rural and remote regions of eastern and southern Europe. There were 12 regions across the EU where this rate exceeded 30.0 % in 2018 (as shown by the darkest blue shade in Map 2). These were situated in Bulgaria, Romania, Spain or Italy. The highest rate was reported in the southern Italian region of Campania (41.4 %), where the risk of poverty was approximately 10 times as high as in BucureAti - Ilfov. People living in a household with very low work intensity The proportion of people living in a household with very low work intensity is one of the three headline criteria used to evaluate poverty and social exclusion in the EU. It is calculated as the share of the population (aged 0-59 years) living in a household where adult members (18-59 years) provided less than 20 % of their total working potential during the previous 12 months. Note that households composed exclusively of students (aged 18-24 years) are excluded and that the statistics presented in this section for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. While some people might view having a job as a guarantee against the risks of poverty or social exclusion, increasing labour market flexibility has led to a growing share of the EUas workforce being employed involuntarily on a temporary or part-time basis or through zero hours contracts. In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis, the number of working poor increased across the EU, with real wages and consumer purchasing power falling in several EU Member States. Less than 1 in 50 people lived in a household characterised by very low work intensity in the capital region of Slovakia a In 2018, the share of the EU-27 population (aged 0-59 years) living in a household with very low work intensity was 8.8 %. An analysis by degree of urbanisation reveals that the highest share of EU-27 households with very low work intensity was recorded among people living in cities (9.7 %), while somewhat lower shares were recorded for those living in towns and suburbs (8.2 %) or rural areas (8.0 %). This pattern was particularly apparent in the cities of western EU Member States, for example, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherland and Austria. Although their cities accounted for a high number of jobs, as witnessed by the influx of commuters into their urban agglomerations every day, they were also somewhat paradoxically home to a relatively high proportion of people living in households with very low work intensity. This may, at least in part, be due to a skills mismatch, pockets of urban unemployment, different household structures, or the precarious nature of some jobs. A more detailed analysis for NUTS level 2 regions reveals that the lowest share of people (aged 0-59 years) living in households with very low work intensity was recorded in BratislavskA12 kraj (1.9 %). There were six other predominantly urban regions located across eastern EU Member States that had very low shares (below 3.0 %), two of which were capital regions: BucureAti - Ilfov and Praha. a while several southern European regions reported that more than 1 in 5 people lived in a household with very low work intensity At the other end of the range, the highest share of people living in households with very low work intensity in 2018 was recorded in Ciudad AutA3noma de Ceuta (34.6 %). The next highest shares were recorded in several island and southern regions of Italy, as well as regions situated in Greece and Spain. It is interesting to note that in Italy and Spain there was a very wide spread across regions between the shares of people living in households with very low work intensity. For example, in Italy the uppermost share was recorded in Sicilia (25.8 %), which was approximately eight times as high as in Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano/Bozen (3.1 %). Material and social deprivation rate The material and social deprivation rate shows the share of the population who could not afford (rather than did not want or did not need) at least 5 out of the following 13 items: to face unexpected expenses; one week annual holiday away from home; to pay on time (mortgage/house loan, rent, utility bills and/or hire purchase instalments) a meal with meat, chicken or fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day; to keep their home adequately warm; a car/van for personal use; to replace worn-out furniture; to replace worn-out clothes with some new ones; to have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; to spend a small amount of money each week on themselves (pocket money); to have regular leisure activities; to get together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month; to have an internet connection. Many of these items are considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate quality of life. Note that the statistics presented in this section for Italy and Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. In two Romanian regions, more than half the population was affected by material and social deprivation The EU-27 material and social deprivation rate stood at 13.2 % in 2018. More than one fifth of the population was impacted by material and social deprivation in every region of Bulgaria, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The Romanian regions of Sud-Est (58.7 %) and Sud - Muntenia (52.9 %) were the only NUTS level 2 regions across the EU where more than half of the population was affected by material and social deprivation. In 2018, less than one tenth of the population was impacted by material and social deprivation in each region of Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Finland and Estonia (see Figure 2). The three Swedish regions of Avre Norrland, Stockholm and SmAland med Aarna had the lowest material and social deprivation rates in the EU (all close to 2.0 %). Income Median equivalised income is a measure of (net) income that takes account of differences in household size and composition. Total household income, derived as the sum of the income received by every member of the household and by the household as a whole, is divided by the equivalised household size to determine the equivalised income attributed to each household member. The use of the median (in contrast to the arithmetic mean) avoids potential distortions that may be caused by the existence of extreme values, such as a few extremely rich individuals/households. The median income of people living in Belgian cities was more than 10 % below the national average In 2018, median equivalised net income in the EU-27 was EUR 16839 per inhabitant, ranging from a high of more than EUR 40000 in Luxembourg down to less than EUR 5000 in Bulgaria and Romania. Figure 3 shows that median income levels per inhabitant in the EU-27 were higher in urban areas (cities or towns and suburbs) than they were in rural areas. A closer examination reveals that the lowest levels of median income were recorded among city-dwellers in four of the western EU Member States a Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria a as well as Malta (where there are no data available for rural areas). In Belgium, the median income of people living in the cities was relatively low, more than 10 % below the national average. These figures tend to reinforce the view that some of the largest cities in western Europe are characterised by pockets of social deprivation, and that some of their highest earners may move out of city centres to satellite towns and suburbs. By contrast, in the 11 Member States that recorded the lowest levels of median income (at a national level), it was consistently the case that city-dwellers had the highest levels of median income, and a with the exception of Czechia a people living in rural areas had the lowest median incomes. The (economic) pull of living in the cities was particularly apparent in three of these Member States, as the median income of city-dwellers in Lithuania and Bulgaria was more than 20 % above the national average, reaching almost 50 % higher in Romania. Housing Some sections of the population are particularly exposed to housing poverty, for example: the unemployed, migrants, single people, people in rented accommodation, and those living in particularly large (and relatively expensive) cities. While for instance elderly homeowners who have paid off their mortgage might be considered to be in a fortunate situation, their income may be low and they are consequently unable to pay for the costs of any necessary repairs or for heating during the winter months. In a similar vein, although social housing and housing benefits constitute a buffer against the effects of poverty, they do not preclude people from living in poverty or in substandard buildings. Distribution of population by dwelling type A dwelling is a room or collection of rooms a including its accessories, lobbies and corridors a in a permanent building or a structurally separated part of a building which is designed for habitation by a private household. Dwellings are found in a range of different types of buildings: the most common distinction is made between houses (detached, semi-detached and terraced) on one hand and flats (or apartments) on the other. More than half (53.3 %) of the EU-27 population lived in a house in 2018, while 46.0 % of the population lived in flats. Note that some people live in other forms of dwelling, for example in student halls of residence, mobile or recreational homes, and houseboats. Other people live in dwellings that form part of non-residential buildings, such as commercial (shopkeepers who live above their shop) or agricultural buildings (living on a farm); these residual types of other dwelling are excluded from the information presented in Figure 4. City-dwellers were more likely to live in a flat, while people living in rural areas were more likely to live in a house In the vast majority of EU Member States, most city-dwellers lived in flats rather than houses; Ireland, the Netherlands and Cyprus were the only exceptions. At the other end of the range, more than four fifths of the population living in the cities of the Baltic Member States, Czechia, Spain, Austria, Slovakia and Greece resided in flats. One of the advantages of living in rural areas is that they generally offer more space. In every one of the EU Member States, a majority of the rural population lived in houses. In Ireland, Hungary and Bulgaria, the rural population was more than 50 times as likely to be residing in a house as in a flat. Housing cost overburden rate Housing costs comprise rental payments, mortgage interest payments, utility costs (such as water or energy charges), the cost of repairs and other local taxes/charges. Together these may account for a considerable proportion of a householdas disposable income. Indeed, rising housing costs are often cited as a key factor impacting on the share of the population affected by monetary poverty. The housing cost overburden rate is defined as the percentage of the population living in a household where total housing costs represent more than 40 % of disposable income (both measures are aneta of housing allowances/benefits). The impact of housing costs on living conditions varies considerably both between and within EU Member States. For example, somebody who lives in central Paris can expect to spend a considerably higher proportion of their income on housing costs, in contrast to someone who lives in Limousin (a rural, sparsely-populated region in central France). People living in cities tended to spend a greater share of their disposable income on housing In 2018, the EU-27 housing cost overburden rate was 9.6 %: this burden was particularly pronounced in Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark and Germany. A more detailed analysis by degree of urbanisation is shown in Figure 5. This reveals that the housing cost overburden rate in the EU-27 was, on average, greater among people living in cities (11.6 %) than among people living in rural areas (7.1 %); this pattern was repeated in a majority of the EU Member States. In France, the Netherlands, Austria and Czechia, the housing cost overburden rate for city-dwellers was more than 2.5 times as high as the corresponding rate for people living in rural areas; this was also the case in Cyprus, although it should be noted that only a very small proportion of the overall population in Cyprus (and Malta) were overburdened by housing costs. While the housing cost overburden rate was typically higher for people living in cities (where the price of owning/renting property tends to be higher), there were some exceptions. In 2018, the highest housing cost overburden rates in all three Baltic Member States were recorded for people living in towns and suburbs, while in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia the highest rates were reported among the rural population; the latter may reflect relatively low income levels in areas characterised by semi-subsistence farming. Severe housing deprivation rate The severe housing deprivation rate is defined as the share of the population living in dwellings that are considered to be overcrowded. An overcrowded household is one that does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms, while also exhibiting at least one of the following housing deprivation measures: a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames or floor; neither a bath nor a shower; no indoor flushing toilet; a dwelling that is considered too dark. In 2018, the EU-27 severe housing deprivation rate was 4.3 %. The highest rates among the EU Member States were recorded in Romania (16.1 %) and Latvia (14.9 %), while much lower shares of the population in Spain, the Netherlands, Malta, Cyprus, Finland and Ireland experienced severe housing deprivation (1.5 % or less). A particularly high share of the rural population in Romania suffered from severe housing deprivation Figure 6 shows that in 2018 the highest shares of severe housing deprivation in the EU-27 were recorded in rural areas (5.2 %), followed by cities (4.4 %) and towns and suburbs (3.3 %). As with several other indicators presented in this article, the severe housing deprivation rate was often highest in eastern and Baltic Member States (where it was usually concentrated in rural areas), whereas many of the western EU Member States reported lower rates (with severe housing deprivation usually more apparent in cities). In 2018, the severe housing deprivation rates for people living in the cities of Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany were more than five times as high as the rate recorded for people living in rural areas. By contrast, the severe housing deprivation rate for people living in rural areas of Romania (26.1 %) was particularly high and more than five times as high as the rate recorded for city-dwellers (4.9 %). It is interesting to note that almost half of the Romanian population in rural areas and in cities lived in overcrowded dwellings. As such, the relatively high severe housing deprivation rate for rural areas could be directly attributed to persistently poor amenities in the stock of rural dwellings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Key findings This article presents statistics related to living conditions experienced by people in the EU. It offers a picture of everyday lives across the EU, focusing on the health status of individuals in the EU-27 and the accessibility they have to healthcare, which may potentially have a profound impact on their living standards. When asked in 2019, just over two thirds (67.8 %) of the EU-27 population aged 18 years and over responded that their health was good or very good. Health conditions The statistics presented in this section are based on an evaluation of self-perceived health. Therefore, readers should bear in mind that cultural and personal differences may have an impact on the results. Two thirds of the EU-27 population perceived themselves as being in good or very good health In 2019, 67.8 % of the EU-27 population aged 18 years and over reported that their health status was good or very good. At the other end of the spectrum, almost 1 in 10 (8.8 %) persons perceived their health status as being bad or very bad (see Figure 1 ). Between the EU Member States, there was a high degree of variation concerning self-perceived health status: in 2019, the share of the population aged 18 years and over that perceived their health to be very good, ranged from 4.6 % in Latvia and less than 10.0 % in Lithuania (low reliability data) and Portugal, up to more than two fifths of the adult population in Ireland, Greece and Cyprus (where a peak of 45.7 % was recorded); the share of the population that reported their health status as very bad was below 4.0 % in each of the EU Member States, with the highest shares recorded in Croatia and Portugal (both 3.8 %). Four fifths of employed persons in the EU-27 perceived themselves as being in good or very good health Figure 2 presents an analysis according to working status of the self-perceived health of the EU-27 population in 2019. Among persons aged 16 years and over, some 81.1 % of those in employment reported that they were in good or very good health, compared with just 2.6 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. The situation was quite different for unemployed persons across the EU-27, as just over two thirds (67.0 %) of this subpopulation perceived their health as being good or very good in 2019, compared with 10.7 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. By contrast, just over two fifths (42.1 %) of retired persons in the EU-27 perceived their health as being good or very good in 2019, compared with 17.7 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. Contrary to the other types of working status, the response most often given by retired persons was that they considered their health to be fair (40.2 %). Perceptions of bad or very bad health status were more prevalent among the elderly, particularly older women As may be expected a given that many health problems tend to be more common among the elderly a there was a clear relationship between a personas age and their (perceived) health status (see Table 1 ). Across the EU-27, 1.4 % of persons aged 16-24 years reported that their health status was bad or very bad in 2019. This share was higher among older age groups, reaching 13.3 % among people aged 65-74 years, 22.5 % among those aged 75-84 years and 34.4 % among those aged 85 years and over. Note that these statistics exclude persons residing in homes for the elderly, where the prevalence of bad or very bad health status is likely to be higher than among the elderly who are living independently. This pattern of a higher share of elderly people (rather than younger people) with bad and very bad health status was repeated in the vast majority of EU Member States. A more detailed analysis of the situation for persons aged 65 years and over is provided in Figure 3. It shows that in 2019 there was a gender gap, insofar as just over one fifth (20.6 %) of elderly women in the EU-27 perceived their health status as bad or very bad, while the corresponding share among men was 4.2 percentage points lower at 16.4 %. The same pattern a a higher share of elderly women (than elderly men) reporting bad or very bad health status a was repeated in 2019 in most of the EU Member States, the only exceptions being Slovenia, France and Finland, where the situation was reversed. This gender gap may, at least in part, be explained by women having a higher level of life expectancy, which may be linked to increased risks for contracting various illnesses/diseases and therefore a deterioration of health status. The smallest differences between the sexes were recorded in Sweden, Ireland, Slovenia and France: these were the only EU Member States where the gender gap was less than 1.0 percentage points. By contrast, the gap between the sexes in 2019 was 11.1 percentage points in Portugal and 12.4 percentage points in Lithuania. In 2019, the share of elderly women that reported bad or very bad health status was more than two fifths in Croatia, Portugal and Lithuania. Croatia also recorded the highest share of elderly men reporting that they had bad or very bad health status (36.8 %), followed by Slovakia (34.0 %). High costs proved to be a barrier to accessing medical care and dental care for 0.9 % and 2.5 % of the EU-27 population The provision of free state-funded medical examinations and treatments varies considerably between EU Member States, reflecting the different organisation of health services and the balance between public and private provisions. Relatively high medical or dental costs may act as a barrier preventing some individual patients from accessing the healthcare they require. Across the EU-27, some 0.9 % of the population aged 16 years and over stated in 2019 that the high cost of medical care was the main reason that resulted in them having unmet medical needs (see Table 2 ). This share varied from less than 1.0 % in 19 EU Member States, up to 2.8 % in Latvia, 3.5 % in Romania and 7.5 % in Greece. Among the first income quintile (in other words, the 20 % of the EU-27 population with the lowest incomes), the share of adults with unmet medical needs due primarily to their cost/expense was 2.1%. By contrast, among the 20 % of highest-earners in the EU-27 (the top or fifth income quintile), the share of adults who stated that their main reason for unmet medical needs was due to their cost/expense was much lower (0.1 %). A similar pattern was repeated in 2019 across nearly all of the EU Member States, with a higher proportion of the adult population in the first income quintile (than the fifth income quintile) reporting unmet medical needs primarily because care was too expensive. The only exceptions were Spain and Sweden where the shares were 0.0 % for the first and fifth quintiles. In Greece, the share of the adult population in the lowest income quintile with unmet medical needs in 2019, primarily because care was too expensive, was 16.6 percentage points higher than the corresponding share recorded among the adult population in the top income quintile; this was the only EU Member State where the gap between the shares for these two subpopulations was in double-digits. In 2019, the share of the adult population in the first income quintile with unmet medical needs, primarily because care was too expensive peaked at 17.4% in Greece, while Romania (6.3 %) and Latvia (6.1 %) reported that more than 5.0 % of this subpopulation had such unmet needs. By contrast, there were 12 EU Member States where less than 1.0 % of the adult population in the first income quintile reported that the principal reason why they had unmet medical needs was because care was too expensive. A similar analysis for the top income quintile in 2019 reveals that Greece also had the highest share (0.8 %) of this subpopulation with unmet medical needs because care was too expensive; Romania (0.7 %) was the only other EU Member State where more than 0.5 % of the top income quintile reported unmet medical needs due to such care being too expensive. By contrast, 0.0 % of the adults in the top income quintile reported unmet medical needs primarily because care was too expensive in 14 Member States. Although not usually life-threatening, dental conditions may result in excruciating pain, while untreated dental problems may have longer-term detrimental effects on both an individualas health and well-being. In 2019, the share of the EU-27 population aged 16 years and over reporting that the high cost/expense of dental care had resulted in unmet dental care needs was 2.5 % a about 2.8 times the corresponding share for unmet medical needs due to reasons of expense. This may reflect some people giving a higher priority to their medical needs rather than their dental needs and may also be affected by the relatively high level of dental care costs in some EU Member States, in comparison to medical costs which are often (entirely) paid for / reimbursed by social security systems. The share of the population with unmet dental needs primarily due to the cost/expense of treatment ranged from less than 1.0 % in nine EU Member States (with the lowest share being 0.2 %, recorded in Malta) to 8.6 % in Greece, 9.6 % in Portugal and 9.8 % in Latvia. Some 5.5 % of the EU-27as adult population in the lowest income quintile had unmet dental needs in 2019 due to the cost/expense of treatment, compared with 0.6 % of the EU-27 adult population in the top income quintile. Across the EU Member States, people in the bottom income quintile were considerably more likely to have unmet dental needs than their fellow residents in the uppermost income quintile. In Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden, 0.0 % of the adult population in the uppermost (fifth) income quintile had unmet dental needs. Large differences in the amount of money households spent on healthcare National accounts provide information about household consumption expenditure on goods and services. This information may be analysed according to the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP). Division 06 of this classification covers health, including expenditure on: medical products, appliances and equipment; outpatient services; hospital services. On average, a710 were spent on health per inhabitant in the EU-27 in 2019 (see Map 1 ). There were large differences in the level of expenditure in 2019 between EU Member States, from lows in Slovakia (a230 per inhabitant) and Czechia (a250 per inhabitant) up to a1000 or more per inhabitant in Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium (where the highest value was recorded, averaging a1350 per inhabitant). These variations reflect, to some degree, the different provisions for the delivery of healthcare across the EU Member States: on the one hand, there are some characterised by predominantly public systems financed through taxation, where healthcare is provided free at the point of use; others are characterised by social premium payments, whereby patients usually pay their medical bills and are later reimbursed by government. In the Member States where healthcare provision tends to be provided free at the point of use, it is more commonplace to find that expenditure per inhabitant on health was relatively low. A more detailed analysis for the EU-27 reveals that expenditure on health in 2019 was concentrated on medical products, appliances and equipment (43.0 %) and out-patient services (39.4 %), while a relatively small share (17.6 %) was accounted for by hospital services (see Figure 4 ).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Childcare and education arrangements The unequal division of household tasks/duties a including those linked to raising children a is often presented as a key factor when explaining why female employment rates are lower than those recorded for men. This division of tasks may have other implications, such as the gender pay gap or a lack of female participation in social and/or political activities. Almost half of all children under three years of age were cared for only by their parents In 2019, close to half (47.1%) of all children in the EU who were aged less than three years were cared for exclusively by their parents ( see Figure 1 ). This share varied considerably across the EU Member States, from a low of 21.2 % in the Netherlands and 22.6 % in Portugal, up to over 60.0 % in Croatia (60.8 %) in Slovakia (61.2 %) and Latvia (63.8 %), reaching its peak with 69.9 % in Bulgaria. More than one third of children aged less than three years in the EU received formal childcare Children who are not cared for exclusively by their parents may receive formal childcare, other types of childcare, or both. Formal childcare is defined here as regulated childcare provided away from the childas home; it includes, among other things, the time spent at school within compulsory education. Other types of childcare comprise care that is provided by a professional child-minder at the childas home or at the child-mindersa home as well as care provided by grandparents, other household members (outside parents), other relatives, friends or neighbours. In 2019, more than one third (35.3 %) of children in the EU aged less than three years received formal childcare; just over one fifth (21.5 %) of children in this age group received 30 hours or more of formal childcare per week, which was significantly higher than the share (13.8 %) receiving less than 30 hours per week. Among the EU Member States, the share of children aged less than three years receiving at least one hour of formal childcare per week in 2019 peaked at 66.0 % in Denmark. As well as in Denmark, at least half of all children aged less than three years received some formal childcare in the Netherlands (64.8 %), Luxembourg (60.0 %), Spain (57.4 %), Belgium (55.5 %), Sweden (53.1 %), Portugal (52.9 %) and France (50.8 %) a see Table 1 The share of children in the EU that received formal childcare increased according to their age. In 2019, the share of children aged between three years and the minimum compulsory school age receiving some formal childcare was 89.6 %, while it reached 96.7 % among children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years of age. In 2019, Croatia (56.9 %) and Poland (61.3 %) were the only EU Member States to report that only around three fifths of children aged between three years and the minimum compulsory school age received some formal childcare. By contrast, more than 95.0 % of all children in the Netherlands, France, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain and Belgium in this age group received such care. Given that formal childcare includes compulsory education, it is not surprising to find that at least 9 out of 10 children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years received some formal childcare in 2019 in nearly all of the EU Member States: the only exceptions were Romania (87.0 %) and Germany (88.6 %). In addition, Serbia and North Macedonia recorded figures well below 90 %, with 81.8 % and 75.5 % respectively. Around a quarter of all children in the EU under the age of three years received other types of childcare Table 2 provides information in relation to the provision of other types of childcare, with the same analysis by age and duration of childcare as presented in Table 1. In 2019, around one quarter (25.9 %) of all children in the EU under the age of three years received other types of childcare; as such, these types of childcare were somewhat less common than formal childcare (35.3 %). More than two fifths of all children under the age of three years received other types of childcare in Czechia (40.3 %), Greece (41.9 %), Hungary (43.3 %), and Romania where the highest share was recorded, at 53.4 %. For children in the EU between the age of three years and the minimum compulsory school age, the share receiving other types of childcare was comparable to that recorded for children under the age of three years; this share stood at 25.0 % in 2019. A slightly lower share (21.9 %) of children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years received other types of childcare.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Number of seaborne passengers reaches 419 million The number of passengers passing through EU ports increased by 1.8 % between 2018 and 2019, reaching a peak of 418.8 million (Figure 1). After falling regularly between 2008 and 2014, with an exception in 2013 (+0.3 % compared to 2012), the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports recovered in the last five years to reach higher levels than in 2008, which was the previous peak observed (+2.3 % in 2019 compared with 2008). Unlike movements of goods, where broadly 60 % of goods are unloaded and 40 % loaded in the EU ports, the difference between the number of passengers disembarking (\"inwards\") and embarking (\"outwards\") in EU ports is generally small. This reflects the fact that seaborne passenger transport in Europe is mainly carried by national or intra-EU ferry services, with the same passengers being counted twice in the port throughput statistics (once when they embark the ferry in one EU port and once when they disembark the same ferry in another EU port). At 86.5 million and 73.9 million seaborne passengers, respectively, Italian and Greek ports accounted for a combined share of 38.5 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019 (Figure 2). As a consequence, Italy and Greece remained the main countries in terms of EU seaborne passenger transport. The two leading countries were followed by Denmark with 44.2 million passengers embarking and disembarking in 2019, Spain (34.6 million) and Croatia (34.1 million). Compared to the previous year, the largest relative increases in seaborne passengers transport were recorded by Cyprus (+89.3 % from a low base), Bulgaria (+60.9 % from a low base), Portugal (+8.6 %), Spain and Slovenia (both +6.3 %) and Lithuania (+6.2 %) in 2019. The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial growth in 2019 compared to the previous year (+16.6 %). In contrast, only four EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018. The largest decrease was observed in France (-4.1 %), followed by Belgium (-3.1 %), Ireland (-2.3 %) and Finland (-0.2 %). The candidate country Montenegro and the United Kingdom also registered substantial falls in 2019 compared to 2018 (-9.9 % and -4.4 % respectively). Number of seaborne cruise passengers increased to 15 million The number of cruise passengers passing through EU ports increased by 8.6 % between 2018 and 2019, to 14.9 million. Although cruise passengers made up only 3.6 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019, these passengers play an important role in the ports and countries where the cruise traffic is concentrated. Close to 78 % of the total number of cruise passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019 did so in the ports of one of the three countries Italy, Spain, Germany (Figure 3). Cruise passengers on day excursions in EU ports are not included in these figures. With 5.0 million cruise passengers, Italy was the main contributor to the EU seaborne cruise passenger traffic (34 %). Italy was followed by Spain with 3.9 million cruise passengers embarking and disembarking in 2019 and Germany (2.6 million). The United Kingdom also registered a substantial number of cruise passengers with 2.2 million. Compared to the previous year, only two EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: Belgium (-1.4 %) and France (-1.1 %). In contrast, many EU Member States registered substantial increases in 2019 compared to 2018. The three main countries in terms of cruise passengers reported relatively substantial increases: Germany (+13.1 %), Spain (+10.4 %) and Italy (+4.0 %). Messina was the largest European passenger port in 2019 The top 20 passenger ports accounted for close to 36 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in the reporting countries in 2019. The port of Dover, with a 7.0 % decrease in 2019 compared to 2018, lost its position as the largest European passenger port to the benefit of Messina and Helsinki. Messina, which registered a 10.0 % increase in the number of passengers embarking and disembarking from 2018 to 2019 took over the first place, while Helsinki remained in second place, putting Dover in third place (Figure 4). The top 20 passenger ports were the same in 2018 and 2019. However, the position of these ports in the ranking changed for 16 of them. In particular, the port of Napoli gained 5 positions in the ranking, after a 31.0 % increase in 2019 compared to 2018, putting it in 7th place. After Napoli, the port of Reggio di Calabria recorded the largest relative increase between 2018 and 2019 (+16.6 %). In contrast, in addition to Dover, five other ports registered a decrease in 2019 compared to 2018; the most noticeable being for Calais (-7.0 %). Most EU seaborne passenger transport is within national borders Table 1 and Figure 5 show the breakdown of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport between national, international intra-EU and international extra-EU transport for each reporting country. Unlike the other statistics presented in this article, these figures do not reflect the sum of embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in ports, but estimate the transport of passengers between ports. As far as possible, double-counting of the same passengers being reported as embarking in one port and disembarking in another port within the same statistical aggregate is excluded in these figures (see data sources). At 220 million, the EU seaborne transport of passengers (excluding cruise passengers) remained stable between 2018 and 2019 (+0.1 %) (Table 1). Compared to the previous year, only five EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: the most noticeable being for Belgium (-6.3 %) and France (-4.8 %). The candidate country Montenegro registered a substantial fall of 10.2 %. In contrast, the main growths from 2018 to 2019 were recorded for Lithuania (+6.2 %) and Portugal (+6.0 %). The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial increase of 29.8 %. The majority of the seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in the EU is carried out between ports located in the same country (63 %), reflecting the dominant role of national ferry services in the EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport (Figure 5). In general, countries with busy ferry connections to and from well-populated islands will have both a large volume of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport and a high share of national maritime passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport. This applies to the two leading maritime passenger countries, Italy and Greece, as well as countries like Portugal, Croatia and Spain. Countries with ferry connections to other EU countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, naturally have high shares of international intra-EU transport. Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Spain recorded the highest shares of extra-EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in 2019, with Spain having ferry links with Morocco and the other countries with the United Kingdom.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Structural profile Around 1 in 10 (8.9 %) of all enterprises in the EU as non-financial business economy (Sections B to J and L to N and Division 95) were classified to manufacturing (Section C) in 2018, a total of more than 2.0 million enterprises. The manufacturing sector employed 29.9 million persons in 2018 and generated EUR 1944 billion of value added. By these two measures, manufacturing was the second largest of the NACE sections within the EUas non-financial business economy in terms of its contribution to employment (23.1 %) and the largest contributor to non-financial business economy value added, accounting for more than one quarter of the total (29.7 %). In 2018, the EUas manufacturing sector recorded apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs above non-financial business economy averages: the apparent labour productivity of the manufacturing sector was EUR 65000 per person employed, some EUR 14300 more than the non-financial business economy average (EUR 50700 per person employed), while average personnel costs in the manufacturing sector were EUR 42800 per employee, some EUR 7300 above the non-financial business economy average (EUR 35500 per employee). Combining these two ratios into the wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio shows that value added per person employed in the EUas manufacturing sector was equivalent to 152.0 % of average personnel costs per employee, which was slightly above the average for the non-financial business economy (143.0 %). The gross operating rate (the relation between the gross operating surplus and turnover ) was 9.6 % for the EUas manufacturing sector in 2018, below the 10.2 % average for the non-financial business economy, and as such this sector had the second lowest level of profitability (using this measure) among any of the NACE sections within the non-financial business economy, with only distributive trades recording a lower gross operating rate (5.4 %). Sectoral analysis At the NACE division level the manufacturing sector is composed of 24 different subsectors. The largest EU subsectors in 2018 in terms of value added were the manufacture of machinery and equipment (Division 28) and manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (Division 29), while in terms of employment manufacture of food products (Division 10) and the manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment (Division 25) were the largest a see Figure 1. Manufacturing subsectors are very diverse, combining activities with relatively low apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs, such as the manufacture of wearing apparel (Division 14), of leather and related products (Division 15), wood and of products of wood and cork (Division 16), furniture (Division 31), and textiles (Division 13), with other activities that have considerably higher values for the same indicators, such as manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations (Division 21), of coke and refined petroleum products (Division 19) and the manufacture of tobacco products (Division 12)nbsp;see Table 2b. In 2018, apparent labour productivity within the EUas manufacturing subsectors ranged from EUR 22000 per person employed or more for the manufacture of wearing apparel, to EUR 186000 per person employed for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations.In line with their very low apparent labour productivity, the manufacture of wearing apparel and of furniture recorded the lowest average personnel costs in the EUas manufacturing sector, at EUR 17800 per employee and EUR 26000 per employee respectively. Average personnel costs per employee were EUR 73000 per employee for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations, the highest among the manufacturing subsectors and second highest subsector within all of the non-financial economy subsectors. This subsector also recorded second highest apparent labour productivity among NACE divisions within the whole of the non-financial business economy and together with manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products recorded the highest wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio among manufacturing subsectors.On the other side, repair and installation of machinery and equipment (Division 33) recorded the lowest (117.0 %) a see Table 2b. An analysis of the EUas gross operating surplus (value added less personnel costs) gives an idea of the operating profit before depreciation charges. The highest gross operating surplus were recorded for the manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of beverages equivalent to 14.1 % and 13.9 % of turnover respectively. The remaining subsectors mainly recorded gross operating rates between 6.2 % for the manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30) and 11.6 % for the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (Division 23). The one exception was the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products which had a gross operating rate of 4.1 %, its low rate explained, in part, by the capital-intensive nature and relatively high turnover of this transformation activity. Country overview Because of the tradable (export and import) nature of manufactured goods it follows that the relative importance of manufacturing within the non-financial business economy varies greatly between EU Member States and also that specialisations at the subsector level are sometimes very pronounced. Figure 2 shows that the share of manufacturing within the non-financial business economyas value added varied in 2018 from 11.9 % in Luxembourg and 12.6 % in Cyprus to more than 37.0 % of the total in Slovakia and Czechia, with Ireland having the highest share (45.0 %). The range in employment terms was similar, from 11.9 % in the Netherlands to 35.1 % in Czechia. Among the five largest EU Member States, Germany stood out as its manufacturing sector contributed to one third (33.4 %) of the EUas value added in 2018, above its 28.3 % share of value added in the EUas non-financial business economy as a whole. Italy also recorded a larger share (12.7 %) of the value added generated in the EUas manufacturing sector than it did for the non-financial business economy as a whole (11.5 %), while the reverse was true for France, Spain and the Netherlands. Size class analysis Large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) contributed more to the EUas manufacturing sector than is typical for the non-financial business economy as a whole a in 2018, some 64.6 % of the manufacturing sectoras value added was generated by large enterprises and these employed 47.6 % of the manufacturing employment; for comparison, the non-financial business economy average for large enterprise was a 47.2 % share of value added and a 35.1 % share of the employment. The contribution of large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) to EU value added in 2018 was concentrated in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, tobacco products and of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. The contribution of medium-sized enterprises (employing 50 to 249 persons) to EU value added in 2018 was highest (across the manufacturing sector) in rubber and plastic products, textiles, leather and related products and fabricated metal products except machinery and equipment.In the manufacture of leather and related products, small enterprises (employing 10 to 49 persons) contributed 29.4 % of the subsectorsa value added. Micro enterprises (employing fewer than 10 persons) contributed to the largest share of value added among the four size classes in manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials (29.4 %) and repair and installation of machinery and equipment (28.1 %) a as shown in Figure 6.</td>\n",

Statistics Explained Statistics Explained provides easy access to statistical information concerning the EU. It can be accessed from the homepage of the Eurostat website as well as from the right-hand frame of most dedicated sections. Statistics Explained is an online publishing system about EU statistics which uses MediaWiki technology and resembles Wikipedia. It is a collaborative platform that is used to present statistical articles which together form an encyclopaedia of European statistics, completed by a glossary of the statistical concepts and terms used. In addition, numerous links are provided to the latest data and metadata and to further information, making Statistics Explained a portal for regular and occasional users alike. Statistics Explained pages in English consists of some 700 statistical articles presenting data, 200 background articles on methodological practices or developments, and some 1900 glossary pages defining or explaining terms; these numbers are continuously growing. Reference metadata Metadata dissemination Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX) content oriented guidelines were adopted in January 2009 by seven international organisations: the Euro SDMX metadata structure (ESMS) is a format based on these. ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData > Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading. User support Eurostat and the other members of the ESS have set up a system of user support centres. These exist for nearly all of the EUas official languages and for a range of languages spoken in the EFTA, candidate countries and potential candidates. In order to offer the best possible and personalised support, requests should, whenever possible, be addressed to the relevant language support centre. The mission of each centre is to provide free-of-charge help and guidance to persons having difficulty in finding the statistical data they require. Contact information for these user support centres is available via the a Help a tab on Eurostatas website.

                                                            Introduction The AES provides an overview of the participation of individuals in education and training (i.e. formal and non-formal education and training as well as informal learning). The reference period for the participation in the learning activities is the twelve months prior to the interview. The survey focuses on people aged 25-64. A pilot survey took place around the year 2007 and starting from the 2011 survey the AES is carried out every five years. The following information is available from the AES: Participation in formal education, non-formal education and training and informal learning (respectively labelled FE, NFE and INF); Access to information on learning possibilities; Time spent on education and training; Characteristics of the learning activities; Reasons for not participating; Obstacles to participation; Employer financing and costs of learning; Self-reported language skills. Comparable data from 2007, 2011 and 2016 AES can be found in the following folders of the database: Participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m0); Participation in informal learning (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m4); Access to information on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m1); Time spent on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m2); Obstacles to participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m3); Self-reported language skills (educ_lang_00). Coverage and mandate Three waves of the AES have been implemented so far. The first AES (2007 AES) was a pilot survey conducted in 26 EU Member States (Ireland and Luxembourg did not participate), as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Tukey. This first wave was carried out based on a gentlemenas agreement between 2005 and 2008 (depending on the country). The second wave (2011 AES) was conducted in 27 EU Member States (Croatia did not participate), Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia and Turkey between July 2011 and June 2012. This statistical operation was for the first time conducted under the institutional mandate set in Regulation 452/2008, and implemented by Regulation 823/2010. This legal basis establishes the collection of data on the participation of adults (aged 25a64) in learning activities every five years. The third wave (2016 AES) was conducted in 28 EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between July 2016 and March 2017. Regulation 1175/2014 provided the implementation details of this wave. Further information on each wave is available in the reference metadata and in the implementation manuals. Basic concepts Lifelong learning encompasses all learning activities undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences, within personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or aim to learn is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sporting activities. Adult learning means the participation of adults in lifelong learning. Adult learning usually refers to learning activities after the end of initial education. The participation rate in education and training covers participation in both formal and non-formal education and training. Learning activities are any activities of an individual organised with the intention to improve their knowledge, skills, and competences. There are two fundamental criteria that distinguish learning activities from non-learning activities: they must be intentional and organised. Intentional learning (as opposed to random learning) is defined as a deliberate search for knowledge, skills or competences or attitudes of lasting value. Organised learning is defined as learning planned in a pattern or sequence with explicit or implicit aims. The learning activities are defined within a classification named classification of learning activities (CLA). The current version of the CLA (2016 edition) is aligned with ISCED 2011. The 2016 edition of the CLA applies to the 2016 AES. 2007 and 2011 AES refer to the 2006 edition of the CLA; however, data between the waves are overall comparable. The CLA defines three main types of learning activities as follows: Formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned through public organisations and recognised private bodies, and - in their totality - constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education or equivalent authorities, e.g. any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub-national education authorities. Formal education consists mostly of initial education [...]. Vocational education, special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system. Qualifications from formal education are by definition recognised and, therefore, are within the scope of ISCED. Institutionalised education occurs when an organisation provides structured educational arrangements, such as student-teacher relationships and/or interactions, that are specially designed for education and learninga. [1] Non-formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided in order to guarantee the right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a continuous pathway structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity; and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Nevertheless, formal, recognised qualifications may be obtained through exclusive participation in specific non-formal education programmes; this often happens when the non-formal programme completes the competencies obtained in another contexta. [2] Informal learning is aintentional, but it is less organised and less structured... and may include for example learning events (activities) that occur in the family, in the workplace, and in the daily life of every person, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis.a [3] Job-related non-formal education and training : the respondent takes part in the non-formal education and training activity in order to obtain knowledge and/or learn new skills needed for a current or future job, to increase earnings, to improve job and/or career opportunities in a current or another field and generally to improve his/her opportunities for advancement and promotion. Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal education and training : all job-related non-formal education and training activities paid at least partially by the employer and/or done during paid working hours. Usual breakdowns and classifications Educational attainment level Educational attainment level is the highest level of education successfully completed by an individual. Educational attainment is classified according to the International standard classification of education (ISCED). This classification allows for international comparability between the different national education systems, introducing criteria to categorise the education levels into a common nomenclature. It therefore facilitates comparisons across countries based on uniform and internationally agreed definitions. The successful completion of an education programme must be validated by a recognised qualification, i.e. a qualification officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance. When determining the highest level, both general and vocational education should be taken into consideration. 2016 AES was classified according to ISCED 2011; 2007 and 2011 AES were classified under ISCED 1997. The AES data dissemination considers three broad levels of aggregation: Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education (levels 0 to 2 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 0, 1 and 2 but also include level 3C short (educational attainment from ISCED level 3 programmes of less than two years); Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (levels 3 and 4 of ISCED 2011). ISCED 2011 level 3 programmes of partial level completion are considered within ISCED level 3. Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 3C long, 3A, 3B and 4; Tertiary education (levels 5 to 8 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 5 and 6. Occupation Occupation is defined as the task and duties undertaken by each worker in their job. The International standard classification of occupations (ISCO) organises jobs into a clearly defined set of groups. 2011 and 2016 AES were classified according to ISCO-08; 2007 AES was classified under ISCO-COM 88. Data are directly comparable for the categories shown online. Four categories of employee occupations are distinguished in the online tables on occupation: Managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals; Clerical support workers, service and sales workers; Skilled manual workers; and Elementary occupations. Foreign languages - level of self-reported knowledge The knowledge of foreign languages is self-reported by the respondents and is categorised in three levels in the 2011 AES questionnaire. The labels displayed in the online tables of domain educ_lang_00 correspond to the following self-reported knowledge: Fair : I can understand and use the most common everyday expressions. I use the language in relation to familiar things and situations; Good : I can understand the essential of clear language and produce simple text. I can describe experiences and events and communicate fairly fluently; and Proficient : I can understand a wide range of demanding texts and use the language flexibly. I master the language almost completely. In the 2007 and 2016 AES, a fourth a basic a level was included in the questionnaire: aI only understand and can use a few wordsa. In the online tables that fourth category is included in the category a fair a. Degree of urbanisation Three types of areas are defined based on population density: cities : at least 50% of the population lives in urban centres; towns and suburbs : at least 50% of the population lives in urban clusters and less than 50% of the population lives in urban centres; rural areas : at least 50% of the population lives in rural grid cells. Questionnaire The 2016 AES European standard questionnaire has the following structure: 1.0 - General information 1.1 - Information on the household 1.2 - Information on the individual 1.3 - Access to information about learning possibilities 1.4 - Participation in education and training 1.5 - Difficulties in participation in education 1.6 - Informal learning 1.7 - Languages 1.8 - Household income National questionnaires a which are based on the standard questionnaire for the sake of cross-country comparability a are available on this link.



                                                                                                               Participation rate of adults in learning in the last four weeks The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training adopted in May 2009 had set a number of benchmarks to be achieved by 2020, including one for adult participation in learning, namely that an average of at least 15 % of adults aged 25 to 64 years old should participate in lifelong learning. In 2020, the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 in the EU who participated in education or training was 9.2 %; a share that was 0.9 percentage points lower than the corresponding share for 2015 and 1.6 points lower compared to 2019. It is considered that part of the decrease could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. cancellation of training activities. The adult learning indicator refers to participation in formal and non-formal education and training and the reference period for the participation is the four weeks preceding the interview as is usual in the labour force survey. (see Table 1). Denmark, Finland and Sweden stood out from the other EU Member States as they reported considerably higher proportions of their respective adult populations participating in lifelong learning in the four weeks preceding the interview, ranging from 20.0 % to 28.6 %. Estonia, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were the only other Member States where the participation rate in 2020 exceeded the 15 % benchmark. By contrast, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia and Poland reported adult learning rates of less than 4.0 %. The proportion of the population who had participated in adult learning was higher among women (10.0 % in 2020) in the EU than among men (8.3 %); the shares for men and women were both lower in 2020 than they had been five years earlier. The participation rate of both women and men increased continuously until 2019 and fell in 2020 only, i.e. with the onset of the COVID-2019 pandemic. In 2020, women recorded higher participation rates than men in all EU Member States except for Czechia, Germany, Greece and Cyprus (where rates for men were higher), while Romania reported the same rate for both sexes. The largest gender difference, in percentage points, was in Sweden, where the participation rate for women was 13.6 percentage points higher than for men. Participation rate of adults in learning in the last 12 months In addition to the data from the labour force survey which provides information on participation in education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey interview, information on education and training is available from the adult education survey (AES). The AES measures participation in learning activities with a longer reference period (12 months preceding the survey interview) and therefore is likely to cover more learning activities, resulting in higher participation rates in formal and non-formal education and training. However, it is carried out less frequently (from 2016 every six years). The most recent wave of the survey was conducted between July 2016 and March 2017 (and named the 2016 AES). According to this survey, in 201643.7 % of people in the EU aged 25 to 64 took part in education and training (during the 12 months preceding the interview), the majority of which participating in non-formal education and training (see Figure 1). For the EU as a whole, participation rates in education and training in the 12 months preceding the interview were almost the same for men and women. In Cyprus, Czechia, Hungary and Italy, men were considerably more likely than women to have participated in education and training, whereas the reverse was true in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Lithuania (see Table 2). An analysis by age shows that the participation of younger persons (aged 25a34) in the EU was more than 20 percentage points higher than that of older ones (aged 55a64) in 2016. Participation in education and training among older persons was particularly low in Romania and Greece. The likelihood of participation in education and training was related to the level of educational achievement: persons with a tertiary level education reported the highest participation rates (64.5 % for the EU in 2016), while those having completed at most lower secondary education were the least likely to have participated (22.9 %). Providers of non-formal education and training activities Employers were the most common providers of non-formal education and training activities, providing more than one third (33.7 %) of such activities in the EU according to the 2016 adult education survey (see Table 3). Employers provided almost two thirds of non-formal education and training in Bulgaria, and three fifths of such activities in Hungary. Among the less common providers of non-formal education and training in the EU as a whole, the relative importance of non-formal education and training institutions was particularly high in Poland (48.7 %) and Slovenia (36.7 %), formal education institutions were frequent providers in Lithuania and Finland, and commercial institutions (where education and training is not the main activity) in Sweden (see Table 3). Participation in informal learning activities Next to information on participation in formal and non-formal education and training, the adult education survey also collects information on informal learning. Typical forms of informal learning are taught learning via coaching or guided visits to e.g. museums. Informal learning can also take place as non-taught learning, e.g. as self-learning or as learning in a group with friends or colleagues. In 2016, 59.7 % of adults aged 25-64 in the EU reported participation in any informal learning in the 12 months preceding the interview (see Table 4). Participation in informal learning ranged from below 35 % in Lithuania and Poland to over 90 % in Croatia and Cyprus. In the majority of countries women were more likely than men to participate in this type of learning. Not very surprisingly, informal learning by using a computer (or similar devices) is reported to be the most frequent form of informal learning in most countries.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Formal and non-formal adult education and training About 44 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in some form of education or training Among adults of working age (25a64), 43.7 % across the EU took part in formal or non-formal education or training in 2016. This marked an increase of 3.5 percentage points compared with the previous survey, which was conducted in 2011, when 40.2 % of the working-age population had participated in formal or non-formal education or training. In 2007, this share was 32.8 %. In 2016, the majority of the non-formal education and training that was undertaken in the EU by people aged 25a64 was job-related rather than for personal fulfilment. Training courses, seminars, conferences and guided-on-the-job training are key elements for providing job-related training; while the latter type is usually very short, the other types tend to be of a slightly longer duration (typically one or two days). Guided-on-the-job training is characterised by planned periods of training, instruction or practical experience, using normal tools of work, either at the immediate place of work or in the work-situation with the presence of a tutor. In the Netherlands and Sweden, the share of the working-age population participating in education and training rose to 64 % Among the EU Member States, there was a considerable variation between the shares of adult working-age populations who participated in formal and non-formal education or training. In 2016, the highest proportions were recorded in the Netherlands (64.1 %) and Sweden (63.8 %), while 50a60 % of working-age adults in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Finland, Hungary and Austria participated in some form of education and training. A small majority, 16 of the Member States recorded participation rates between 25 and 50 %, while Greece (16.7 %) and Romania (7.0 %) recorded much lower participation rates (see Figure 1). Adult education and training by field of study An analysis of the instruction hours spent by field of study reveals that in 2016 less than one fifth (17.5 %) of the formal and non-formal education and training that was given to adults aged 25a64 in the EU concerned business, administration and law. There were two fields of study which each accounted for around 15 % of the total hours spent by adults in instruction: services; and health and welfare. Arts and humanities; and engineering, manufacturing and construction were the only other fields to record double-digit shares. Business, administration & law and health & welfare accounted for the biggest shares of adult education and training Table 1 highlights that, while business, administration and law was the most popular field of study in terms of hours spent for adult education and training in the EU in 2016, with eight Member States recording their highest shares in this domain, health and welfare was just behind with seven Member States. Among the other Member States, five recorded highest shares in services, four in arts and humanities and two in engineering, manufacturing and construction (Estonia registering its highest share in both health & welfare and engineering, manufacturing and construction). The remaining two countries recorded high non response. Adult education and training: relative importance of formal and non-formal instruction Non-formal instruction is the most frequent type of education and training The majority of adult education and training in the EU is non-formal education and training, in other words, outside of formal institutions of schools, colleges and universities. This is not surprising given that the age criterion for the AES is persons of working age (25a64 years-old), when most people have already completed their formal studies. In 2016, more than two fifths (41.4 %) of the EUas adult working-age population participated in non-formal education and training, a share that was more than eight times as high as the share of those who participated in formal education or training (5.0 %). Formal education and training was relatively common in Finland (14.2 % of working-age adults), Sweden (13.8 %) and Denmark (13.5 %); all of the remaining EU Member States reported single-digit shares. By contrast, fewer than 3 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in formal education and training in Bulgaria, Czechia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia (see Figure 1). A higher proportion of the instruction given in health and welfare was provided in a formal setting, while the opposite was true for services Figure 3 provides an analysis of the relative importance of different fields of study in terms of instruction hours, contrasting formal and non-formal education and training. In 2016, health and welfare accounted for 18.8 % of the total number of hours adults spent in formal education and training in the EU compared with 11.5 % of hours spent in non-formal education and training. Engineering, manufacturing and construction accounted also for a considerably higher proportion of the formal instruction hours of adults in the EU in 2016 (when compared with its share of non-formal instruction hours), while the relative share of services in non-formal instruction hours was considerably higher than its share in formal instruction hours. In a similar vein, social sciences, journalism and information as well as natural sciences, mathematics and statistics accounted for a relatively high share of the total number of hours of formal instruction that were given to adults, while arts and humanities, Information and Communication Technologies and generic programmes and qualifications accounted for relatively high shares of the total number of hours of non-formal education and training. Focus on non-formal adult education and training The remainder of this article concentrates on the most common type of adult learning, non-formal education and training. The AES provides information on basically all non-formal learning activities in which an adult participated during the last 12 months. Therefore it is possible to analyse at the level of non-formal activities. The shares presented in this section are generally shown in relation to the total number of non-formal activities. Formal education and training of adults is not covered hereafter. Relative importance of job-related non-formal adult education and training In 2016, approximately four fifths (78.8 %) of the non-formal education and training activities of adults in the EU were job-related and almost one fifth (19.4 %) was not job-related; the remaining 1.8 % concerned non-formal activities where there was no response whether it was job-related or not. The share of non-formal learning activities that was job-related ranged among the EU Member States from highs of more than 90 % in Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, down to 55.6 % in Hungary (see Table 2). A higher proportion of non-formal learning activities of adult men rather than adult women was job-related Within the EU in 2016, a high proportion (83.2 %) of non-formal learning activities of men was job-related. This share could be compared with the corresponding value for women, where just below three quarters (74.6 %) of all non-formal learning activities were job-related. This gender gap was apparent in 26 EU Member States. The only exception was Cyprus, where the share of job-related non-formal learning activities was higher for women than for men: 79.3 % against 66.3 %. In contrast, while 90.5 % of the non-formal learning activities of men in Greece were job-related, the corresponding share for women was 17.0 percentage points lower. This was the largest gender gap among the EU Member States, ahead of Italy (14.8 points difference), while France, Czechia and Malta all reported double-digit differences (again with a higher share of non-formal learning activities of adult men being job-related). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to become slightly higher as people moved towards the 45a54 years age group In 2016, the share of non-formal learning activities in the EU that was job-related rose slightly as a function of age from 77.3 % for those aged 25a34 to a peak of 81.7 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 71.8 % among those aged 55a64. While considerably more than half of the non-formal learning of people aged 55a64 continued to be job-related, the relatively low shares for this age group suggest that some older persons were preparing for retirement by expanding their knowledge or skills in non-job related areas (see Figure 4). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to be higher among adults with a tertiary level of educational attainment An analysis by level of educational attainment (see Figure 4) suggests that adults in the EU with a tertiary level of educational attainment were more likely to follow some form of job-related education and training. In 2016, some 79.8 % of the non-formal learning activities of people aged 25a64 with a tertiary level of educational attainment (ISCED 2011 levels 5 to 8) were job-related, compared with 74.1 % among those with a low level of educational attainment (ISCED levels 0-2). At the same time, for adults with an intermediate educational attainment (ISCED levels 3-4) a share almost as high as for those with a tertiary education can be observed (78.6 %). Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal adult education and training Figure 5 shows the relative contribution of sponsorship from employers to job-related non-formal education and training. In 2016, some 68.4 % of the non-formal education and training activities of adults were job-related and sponsored by employers, while 10.4 % of the activities were job-related and financially supported by other means. With almost four fifths of all non-formal learning activities of adults in the EU being work-related, it is perhaps unsurprising to find that the vast majority of this was sponsored by employers providing financial support to their workforce in the form of training designed to improve the knowledge of their staff. The relatively high shares of education and training that are sponsored by employers may also be linked to the general affordability of training, which may be prohibitive for many people on an individual basis. A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by men were job-related and sponsored by employers A more detailed examination of these figures shows that employers provided financial support more often to male (rather than female) employees in order to follow job-related non-formal instruction. Almost three quarters (73.5 %) of the non-formal education and training activities followed by adult men in the EU were job-related and sponsored by employers, while among adult women the share was less than two thirds (63.5 %) a see Figure 5. Note these shares also reflect the lower proportion of women (than men) who participate in job-related non-formal education and training, which may, at least in part, be linked to lower employment rates among women; the EU employment rate for women aged 25a64 was 66.2 % in 2016, compared with a rate of 78.5 % for men of the same age. The share of non-formal training activities followed by adults that were both job-related and sponsored by employers peaked at 92.8 % in Bulgaria and 84.7 % in Slovakia, reflecting their high shares of overall job-related non-formal education and training. In contrast, less than half of the non-formal instruction was both job-related and sponsored by employers in Hungary (48.2 %) and Greece (34.8 %). The largest gender gaps for the share of adult non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers were recorded in Czechia and Italy, where the share for men was 15.0 and 14.3 percentage points higher than that for women. The gender gap was between 12.0 and 14.0 points (again in favour of men) in France, Latvia and Malta; even larger differences between the sexes were recorded in Turkey (24.8 percentage points). A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by those aged 45a54 were job-related and sponsored by employers Across the EU in 2016, some 64.8 % of the non-formal learning activities followed by adults aged 25a34 were job-related and sponsored by employers (see Figure 5). This share rose to 71.3 % among those aged 35a44 and 72.2 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 62.7 % for those aged 55a64. Note these figures reflect, to some degree, the relatively high proportion of non-formal education and training that was job-related among people aged 45a54. The initial increase with age may, at least in part, reflect the interest of employers and employees in keeping skills up-to-date, with this interest dropping off as employees get closer to the end of their working lives. While the share of job-related non-formal education and training activities that were financed by employers rose as a function of age up to the 45a54 age group for the EU as a whole, there was a mixed picture among the EU Member States (see Table 3). In 2016, there were 13 Member States where the highest share of non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers was recorded among those aged 45a54. There were 10 Member States where the highest share was recorded for those aged 35a44 and five where the highest share was for those aged 55a64 (Bulgaria recorded the highest share for both 45-54 and 55-64). In the absence of employer sponsorship, young adults were the most likely to undertake job-related education and training In 2016, the share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related but not sponsored by employers fell as a function of age (see Figure 5). This suggests that younger persons (25a34) were the most likely to undertake job-related non-formal instruction without employer sponsorship, while older persons (55a64) were the least likely (perhaps due to a shorter time horizon to benefit from any job-related education and training). A similar analysis by educational attainment level (see Figure 5 and Table 3) shows that in 2016 a relatively high proportion (68.2 %) of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken in the EU by those with a tertiary level of education was job-related and sponsored by employers. An even higher share (69.9 %) was recorded for those with an intermediate educational attainment, whereas the share recorded among those with a low level of educational attainment was lower, at 62.9 %. Job-related non-formal instruction by field of study Within the EU in 2016, more than one fifth (22.6 %) of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within the field of business, administration and law. There were three other fields of study which accounted for double-digit shares: services (19.5 %), health and welfare (14.2 %) and Information and Communication Technologies (10.6 %) (see Figure 6). In 2016, across 17 of the EU Member States, more than one fifth of the non-formal job-related instruction was within the field of business, administration and law. This share peaked at 32.5 % in Sweden and was followed by Germany (28.5 %) and Cyprus (27.5 %) (see Table 4). More than one fifth of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within services in eight of the EU Member States. This included Spain, with a share that was just above 20 %, while almost one third (32.9 %) of the non-formal job-related instruction in Hungary was in the field of services, a share that rose to around two fifths in Bulgaria (38.5 %) and Slovakia (43.5 %). There was also more than one fifth of job-related non-formal instruction of adults given over to health and welfare in Malta and Ireland. Another 21 EU Member States recorded shares that were in double-digits, and only Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary reported shares below 10 %.  \n",

messages The concept of high nature value farmland refers to the causality between certain types of farming activity and corresponding environmental outcomes, including high levels of biodiversity and the presence of environmentally valuable habitats and species. High nature value farmland is therefore a key indicator for the assessment of the impact of policy interventions with respect to the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems dependent on agriculture and of traditional rural landscapes. As environmental objectives become increasingly important for the Common agricultural policy (CAP) and with increasing pressure on resources, complementarity and convergence between the agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) and the monitoring and evaluation framework being developed for the CAP is being sought wherever possible. Assessment A wide variety of approaches and combinations of methods are currently being used across the EU to assess the extent of HNV farmland. Whilst good progress has been made in assessing the extent of HNV farmland, the assessment of its condition or quality still presents a considerable challenge. Due to the variation in data availability across the EU Member States and regions of the EU and the range of physical situations (territory size, farm structure and systems, predominant land and habitat types), it is not appropriate to impose a common methodology for the assessment of HNV farmland. Use of one single method would restrict the analysis to data available throughout the EU, which would exclude the richest and most relevant data sources, and preclude those Member States which have developed more refined methods from using them, with a consequent reduction in the quality and accuracy of the assessment. Agreement on the common parameters being measured, and transparency and acceptance of the various methodologies, does allow for comparability and aggregation, provided that methodology appropriate to identifying land fulfilling the criteria for one of the three HNV types in that biophysical situation is used. It is however important that in each territory the same methodology is used for successive assessments, so that trends can be correctly estimated. AEI 23 - High nature value farmland is proposed as one of the impact indicators to be included in the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework for 2014-2020. As such it will fall under the provisions of Article 110 of the proposed CAP Horizontal Regulation ( Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 ), associated implementing rules, and the legislative framework for rural development. EU Member States will therefore be required to supply values for this indicator (a baseline situation, plus updates at specific points during the period) in the context of the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework. In particular it will be needed for the baseline description of each Rural Development Programme (RDP) territory, and the subsequent evaluation of RDPs.  \n",

       "860   Poverty and deprivation There are two principal measures of poverty. Relative poverty concerns the situation where people whose income and/or resources prevent them from enjoying a anormala standard of living for the society in which they live. By contrast, absolute poverty is the deprivation of basic human needs, for example, a lack of food, water, sanitation facilities, health or education. Based on the above definitions, the most common form of poverty in the EU is relative poverty. People at risk of poverty or social exclusion The risk of poverty or social exclusion is a broader concept than just the risk of poverty. It does not depend exclusively on a householdas level of income, as it may also be a reflection of deprivation or joblessness. The number/share of people at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion combines three separate criteria covering people who are in at least one of the following situations: at-risk-of-poverty a people with a median equivalised disposable income (after social transfers ) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold ; suffering from severe material deprivation a people unable to afford at least four out of nine material items that are considered by most to be desirable (or even necessary) for having an adequate quality of life; living in a household with very low work intensity a where working-age adults worked no more than 20 % of their total potential during the previous 12 months. In 2018, more than one fifth of the EU-27 population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU-27 climbed to reach a peak of 108.7 million people in 2012. There followed six consecutive annual reductions, as the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion fell to 94.8 million by 2018; this latest figure was equivalent to 21.6 % of the EU-27 population. Map 1 shows the regional distribution of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion across NUTS level 2 regions. Note that the statistics presented for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, France and Portugal. The share of the population that was at risk of poverty or social exclusion was skewed, as approximately three fifths of all regions in the EU (114 out of the 187 for which data are available) recorded a share below the EU-27 average. At the bottom end of the distribution, only four regions reported less than 10 % of their population being at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2018: three Czech regions in Bohemia (including the capital region, Praha) and the Slovakian capital region of BratislavskA12 kraj. While some of the lowest risks of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in predominantly urban regions of eastern EU Member States, this was often in stark contrast to the situation in more rural regions. In 2018, there were 10 regions situated in eastern and southern EU Member States where more than 40 % of the population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion (as shown by the darkest shade in the map); these regions were situated in Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Spain and Italy. The highest risk of poverty or social exclusion was recorded in two southern Italian regions a Campania (53.6 %) and Sicilia (51.6 %). At-risk-of-poverty rate The European social model is based on offering protection to those who are most in need. When comparing at-risk-of-poverty rates before and after social transfers it is possible to make an assessment of the impact of welfare systems. In 2018, some 25.0 % of the EU-27 population was exposed to monetary poverty, with this proportion falling to 16.8 % after social transfers. Note that at-risk-of-poverty rates do not measure (a lack of) income in itself, rather they provide information on the share of the population with a level of income that is below a set threshold; this does not necessarily imply a low overall standard of living. In 2018, Czechia, Denmark, Slovenia and Finland were the only multi-regional EU Member States to report that every region had an at-risk-of-poverty rate (after social transfers) that was below the EU-27 average (see Map 2). Note that the statistics presented for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. The lowest at-risk-of-poverty rates were recorded in capital regions of eastern EU Member States Looking in more detail, people living in the capital regions of many eastern and some southern EU Member States were less likely to be at risk of poverty than their rural populations. The Romanian capital region of BucureAti - Ilfov had the lowest risk of poverty (4.1 %) among NUTS level 2 regions in 2018 and was followed by three more capital regions a BratislavskA12 kraj (4.3 %), Praha (6.0 %) and Helsinki-Uusimaa (6.9 %). By contrast, the opposite pattern was apparent in several western Member States. Despite their capital regions (and other large cities) often being among the most affluent regions in the EU, they were often characterised by pockets of social deprivation in specific neighbourhoods. For example, more than one fifth (21.3 %; 2017 data) of the population in the Austrian capital region of Wien was at risk of poverty, a higher share than in any other region of Austria. A similar pattern was apparent in Denmark, as the highest risk of poverty was recorded in the capital region of Hovedstaden (15.2 % in 2018). Some of the highest at-risk-of-poverty rates were recorded in rural and remote regions of eastern and southern Europe. There were 12 regions across the EU where this rate exceeded 30.0 % in 2018 (as shown by the darkest blue shade in Map 2). These were situated in Bulgaria, Romania, Spain or Italy. The highest rate was reported in the southern Italian region of Campania (41.4 %), where the risk of poverty was approximately 10 times as high as in BucureAti - Ilfov. People living in a household with very low work intensity The proportion of people living in a household with very low work intensity is one of the three headline criteria used to evaluate poverty and social exclusion in the EU. It is calculated as the share of the population (aged 0-59 years) living in a household where adult members (18-59 years) provided less than 20 % of their total working potential during the previous 12 months. Note that households composed exclusively of students (aged 18-24 years) are excluded and that the statistics presented in this section for Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. While some people might view having a job as a guarantee against the risks of poverty or social exclusion, increasing labour market flexibility has led to a growing share of the EUas workforce being employed involuntarily on a temporary or part-time basis or through zero hours contracts. In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis, the number of working poor increased across the EU, with real wages and consumer purchasing power falling in several EU Member States. Less than 1 in 50 people lived in a household characterised by very low work intensity in the capital region of Slovakia a In 2018, the share of the EU-27 population (aged 0-59 years) living in a household with very low work intensity was 8.8 %. An analysis by degree of urbanisation reveals that the highest share of EU-27 households with very low work intensity was recorded among people living in cities (9.7 %), while somewhat lower shares were recorded for those living in towns and suburbs (8.2 %) or rural areas (8.0 %). This pattern was particularly apparent in the cities of western EU Member States, for example, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherland and Austria. Although their cities accounted for a high number of jobs, as witnessed by the influx of commuters into their urban agglomerations every day, they were also somewhat paradoxically home to a relatively high proportion of people living in households with very low work intensity. This may, at least in part, be due to a skills mismatch, pockets of urban unemployment, different household structures, or the precarious nature of some jobs. A more detailed analysis for NUTS level 2 regions reveals that the lowest share of people (aged 0-59 years) living in households with very low work intensity was recorded in BratislavskA12 kraj (1.9 %). There were six other predominantly urban regions located across eastern EU Member States that had very low shares (below 3.0 %), two of which were capital regions: BucureAti - Ilfov and Praha. a while several southern European regions reported that more than 1 in 5 people lived in a household with very low work intensity At the other end of the range, the highest share of people living in households with very low work intensity in 2018 was recorded in Ciudad AutA3noma de Ceuta (34.6 %). The next highest shares were recorded in several island and southern regions of Italy, as well as regions situated in Greece and Spain. It is interesting to note that in Italy and Spain there was a very wide spread across regions between the shares of people living in households with very low work intensity. For example, in Italy the uppermost share was recorded in Sicilia (25.8 %), which was approximately eight times as high as in Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano/Bozen (3.1 %). Material and social deprivation rate The material and social deprivation rate shows the share of the population who could not afford (rather than did not want or did not need) at least 5 out of the following 13 items: to face unexpected expenses; one week annual holiday away from home; to pay on time (mortgage/house loan, rent, utility bills and/or hire purchase instalments) a meal with meat, chicken or fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day; to keep their home adequately warm; a car/van for personal use; to replace worn-out furniture; to replace worn-out clothes with some new ones; to have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; to spend a small amount of money each week on themselves (pocket money); to have regular leisure activities; to get together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month; to have an internet connection. Many of these items are considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate quality of life. Note that the statistics presented in this section for Italy and Poland relate to NUTS level 1 regions and that only national data are available for Belgium, Germany, France and Portugal. In two Romanian regions, more than half the population was affected by material and social deprivation The EU-27 material and social deprivation rate stood at 13.2 % in 2018. More than one fifth of the population was impacted by material and social deprivation in every region of Bulgaria, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The Romanian regions of Sud-Est (58.7 %) and Sud - Muntenia (52.9 %) were the only NUTS level 2 regions across the EU where more than half of the population was affected by material and social deprivation. In 2018, less than one tenth of the population was impacted by material and social deprivation in each region of Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Finland and Estonia (see Figure 2). The three Swedish regions of Avre Norrland, Stockholm and SmAland med Aarna had the lowest material and social deprivation rates in the EU (all close to 2.0 %). Income Median equivalised income is a measure of (net) income that takes account of differences in household size and composition. Total household income, derived as the sum of the income received by every member of the household and by the household as a whole, is divided by the equivalised household size to determine the equivalised income attributed to each household member. The use of the median (in contrast to the arithmetic mean) avoids potential distortions that may be caused by the existence of extreme values, such as a few extremely rich individuals/households. The median income of people living in Belgian cities was more than 10 % below the national average In 2018, median equivalised net income in the EU-27 was EUR 16839 per inhabitant, ranging from a high of more than EUR 40000 in Luxembourg down to less than EUR 5000 in Bulgaria and Romania. Figure 3 shows that median income levels per inhabitant in the EU-27 were higher in urban areas (cities or towns and suburbs) than they were in rural areas. A closer examination reveals that the lowest levels of median income were recorded among city-dwellers in four of the western EU Member States a Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria a as well as Malta (where there are no data available for rural areas). In Belgium, the median income of people living in the cities was relatively low, more than 10 % below the national average. These figures tend to reinforce the view that some of the largest cities in western Europe are characterised by pockets of social deprivation, and that some of their highest earners may move out of city centres to satellite towns and suburbs. By contrast, in the 11 Member States that recorded the lowest levels of median income (at a national level), it was consistently the case that city-dwellers had the highest levels of median income, and a with the exception of Czechia a people living in rural areas had the lowest median incomes. The (economic) pull of living in the cities was particularly apparent in three of these Member States, as the median income of city-dwellers in Lithuania and Bulgaria was more than 20 % above the national average, reaching almost 50 % higher in Romania. Housing Some sections of the population are particularly exposed to housing poverty, for example: the unemployed, migrants, single people, people in rented accommodation, and those living in particularly large (and relatively expensive) cities. While for instance elderly homeowners who have paid off their mortgage might be considered to be in a fortunate situation, their income may be low and they are consequently unable to pay for the costs of any necessary repairs or for heating during the winter months. In a similar vein, although social housing and housing benefits constitute a buffer against the effects of poverty, they do not preclude people from living in poverty or in substandard buildings. Distribution of population by dwelling type A dwelling is a room or collection of rooms a including its accessories, lobbies and corridors a in a permanent building or a structurally separated part of a building which is designed for habitation by a private household. Dwellings are found in a range of different types of buildings: the most common distinction is made between houses (detached, semi-detached and terraced) on one hand and flats (or apartments) on the other. More than half (53.3 %) of the EU-27 population lived in a house in 2018, while 46.0 % of the population lived in flats. Note that some people live in other forms of dwelling, for example in student halls of residence, mobile or recreational homes, and houseboats. Other people live in dwellings that form part of non-residential buildings, such as commercial (shopkeepers who live above their shop) or agricultural buildings (living on a farm); these residual types of other dwelling are excluded from the information presented in Figure 4. City-dwellers were more likely to live in a flat, while people living in rural areas were more likely to live in a house In the vast majority of EU Member States, most city-dwellers lived in flats rather than houses; Ireland, the Netherlands and Cyprus were the only exceptions. At the other end of the range, more than four fifths of the population living in the cities of the Baltic Member States, Czechia, Spain, Austria, Slovakia and Greece resided in flats. One of the advantages of living in rural areas is that they generally offer more space. In every one of the EU Member States, a majority of the rural population lived in houses. In Ireland, Hungary and Bulgaria, the rural population was more than 50 times as likely to be residing in a house as in a flat. Housing cost overburden rate Housing costs comprise rental payments, mortgage interest payments, utility costs (such as water or energy charges), the cost of repairs and other local taxes/charges. Together these may account for a considerable proportion of a householdas disposable income. Indeed, rising housing costs are often cited as a key factor impacting on the share of the population affected by monetary poverty. The housing cost overburden rate is defined as the percentage of the population living in a household where total housing costs represent more than 40 % of disposable income (both measures are aneta of housing allowances/benefits). The impact of housing costs on living conditions varies considerably both between and within EU Member States. For example, somebody who lives in central Paris can expect to spend a considerably higher proportion of their income on housing costs, in contrast to someone who lives in Limousin (a rural, sparsely-populated region in central France). People living in cities tended to spend a greater share of their disposable income on housing In 2018, the EU-27 housing cost overburden rate was 9.6 %: this burden was particularly pronounced in Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark and Germany. A more detailed analysis by degree of urbanisation is shown in Figure 5. This reveals that the housing cost overburden rate in the EU-27 was, on average, greater among people living in cities (11.6 %) than among people living in rural areas (7.1 %); this pattern was repeated in a majority of the EU Member States. In France, the Netherlands, Austria and Czechia, the housing cost overburden rate for city-dwellers was more than 2.5 times as high as the corresponding rate for people living in rural areas; this was also the case in Cyprus, although it should be noted that only a very small proportion of the overall population in Cyprus (and Malta) were overburdened by housing costs. While the housing cost overburden rate was typically higher for people living in cities (where the price of owning/renting property tends to be higher), there were some exceptions. In 2018, the highest housing cost overburden rates in all three Baltic Member States were recorded for people living in towns and suburbs, while in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia the highest rates were reported among the rural population; the latter may reflect relatively low income levels in areas characterised by semi-subsistence farming. Severe housing deprivation rate The severe housing deprivation rate is defined as the share of the population living in dwellings that are considered to be overcrowded. An overcrowded household is one that does not have at its disposal a minimum number of rooms, while also exhibiting at least one of the following housing deprivation measures: a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames or floor; neither a bath nor a shower; no indoor flushing toilet; a dwelling that is considered too dark. In 2018, the EU-27 severe housing deprivation rate was 4.3 %. The highest rates among the EU Member States were recorded in Romania (16.1 %) and Latvia (14.9 %), while much lower shares of the population in Spain, the Netherlands, Malta, Cyprus, Finland and Ireland experienced severe housing deprivation (1.5 % or less). A particularly high share of the rural population in Romania suffered from severe housing deprivation Figure 6 shows that in 2018 the highest shares of severe housing deprivation in the EU-27 were recorded in rural areas (5.2 %), followed by cities (4.4 %) and towns and suburbs (3.3 %). As with several other indicators presented in this article, the severe housing deprivation rate was often highest in eastern and Baltic Member States (where it was usually concentrated in rural areas), whereas many of the western EU Member States reported lower rates (with severe housing deprivation usually more apparent in cities). In 2018, the severe housing deprivation rates for people living in the cities of Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany were more than five times as high as the rate recorded for people living in rural areas. By contrast, the severe housing deprivation rate for people living in rural areas of Romania (26.1 %) was particularly high and more than five times as high as the rate recorded for city-dwellers (4.9 %). It is interesting to note that almost half of the Romanian population in rural areas and in cities lived in overcrowded dwellings. As such, the relatively high severe housing deprivation rate for rural areas could be directly attributed to persistently poor amenities in the stock of rural dwellings.  \n",

It offers a picture of everyday lives across the EU, focusing on the health status of individuals in the EU-27 and the accessibility they have to healthcare, which may potentially have a profound impact on their living standards. When asked in 2019, just over two thirds (67.8 %) of the EU-27 population aged 18 years and over responded that their health was good or very good. Health conditions The statistics presented in this section are based on an evaluation of self-perceived health. Therefore, readers should bear in mind that cultural and personal differences may have an impact on the results. Two thirds of the EU-27 population perceived themselves as being in good or very good health In 2019, 67.8 % of the EU-27 population aged 18 years and over reported that their health status was good or very good. At the other end of the spectrum, almost 1 in 10 (8.8 %) persons perceived their health status as being bad or very bad (see Figure 1 ). Between the EU Member States, there was a high degree of variation concerning self-perceived health status: in 2019, the share of the population aged 18 years and over that perceived their health to be very good, ranged from 4.6 % in Latvia and less than 10.0 % in Lithuania (low reliability data) and Portugal, up to more than two fifths of the adult population in Ireland, Greece and Cyprus (where a peak of 45.7 % was recorded); the share of the population that reported their health status as very bad was below 4.0 % in each of the EU Member States, with the highest shares recorded in Croatia and Portugal (both 3.8 %). Four fifths of employed persons in the EU-27 perceived themselves as being in good or very good health Figure 2 presents an analysis according to working status of the self-perceived health of the EU-27 population in 2019. Among persons aged 16 years and over, some 81.1 % of those in employment reported that they were in good or very good health, compared with just 2.6 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. The situation was quite different for unemployed persons across the EU-27, as just over two thirds (67.0 %) of this subpopulation perceived their health as being good or very good in 2019, compared with 10.7 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. By contrast, just over two fifths (42.1 %) of retired persons in the EU-27 perceived their health as being good or very good in 2019, compared with 17.7 % who reported that they were in bad or very bad health. Contrary to the other types of working status, the response most often given by retired persons was that they considered their health to be fair (40.2 %). Perceptions of bad or very bad health status were more prevalent among the elderly, particularly older women As may be expected a given that many health problems tend to be more common among the elderly a there was a clear relationship between a personas age and their (perceived) health status (see Table 1 ). Across the EU-27, 1.4 % of persons aged 16-24 years reported that their health status was bad or very bad in 2019. This share was higher among older age groups, reaching 13.3 % among people aged 65-74 years, 22.5 % among those aged 75-84 years and 34.4 % among those aged 85 years and over. Note that these statistics exclude persons residing in homes for the elderly, where the prevalence of bad or very bad health status is likely to be higher than among the elderly who are living independently. This pattern of a higher share of elderly people (rather than younger people) with bad and very bad health status was repeated in the vast majority of EU Member States. A more detailed analysis of the situation for persons aged 65 years and over is provided in Figure 3. It shows that in 2019 there was a gender gap, insofar as just over one fifth (20.6 %) of elderly women in the EU-27 perceived their health status as bad or very bad, while the corresponding share among men was 4.2 percentage points lower at 16.4 %. The same pattern a a higher share of elderly women (than elderly men) reporting bad or very bad health status a was repeated in 2019 in most of the EU Member States, the only exceptions being Slovenia, France and Finland, where the situation was reversed. This gender gap may, at least in part, be explained by women having a higher level of life expectancy, which may be linked to increased risks for contracting various illnesses/diseases and therefore a deterioration of health status. The smallest differences between the sexes were recorded in Sweden, Ireland, Slovenia and France: these were the only EU Member States where the gender gap was less than 1.0 percentage points. By contrast, the gap between the sexes in 2019 was 11.1 percentage points in Portugal and 12.4 percentage points in Lithuania. In 2019, the share of elderly women that reported bad or very bad health status was more than two fifths in Croatia, Portugal and Lithuania. Croatia also recorded the highest share of elderly men reporting that they had bad or very bad health status (36.8 %), followed by Slovakia (34.0 %). High costs proved to be a barrier to accessing medical care and dental care for 0.9 % and 2.5 % of the EU-27 population The provision of free state-funded medical examinations and treatments varies considerably between EU Member States, reflecting the different organisation of health services and the balance between public and private provisions. Relatively high medical or dental costs may act as a barrier preventing some individual patients from accessing the healthcare they require. Across the EU-27, some 0.9 % of the population aged 16 years and over stated in 2019 that the high cost of medical care was the main reason that resulted in them having unmet medical needs (see Table 2 ). This share varied from less than 1.0 % in 19 EU Member States, up to 2.8 % in Latvia, 3.5 % in Romania and 7.5 % in Greece. Among the first income quintile (in other words, the 20 % of the EU-27 population with the lowest incomes), the share of adults with unmet medical needs due primarily to their cost/expense was 2.1%. By contrast, among the 20 % of highest-earners in the EU-27 (the top or fifth income quintile), the share of adults who stated that their main reason for unmet medical needs was due to their cost/expense was much lower (0.1 %). A similar pattern was repeated in 2019 across nearly all of the EU Member States, with a higher proportion of the adult population in the first income quintile (than the fifth income quintile) reporting unmet medical needs primarily because care was too expensive. The only exceptions were Spain and Sweden where the shares were 0.0 % for the first and fifth quintiles. In Greece, the share of the adult population in the lowest income quintile with unmet medical needs in 2019, primarily because care was too expensive, was 16.6 percentage points higher than the corresponding share recorded among the adult population in the top income quintile; this was the only EU Member State where the gap between the shares for these two subpopulations was in double-digits. In 2019, the share of the adult population in the first income quintile with unmet medical needs, primarily because care was too expensive peaked at 17.4% in Greece, while Romania (6.3 %) and Latvia (6.1 %) reported that more than 5.0 % of this subpopulation had such unmet needs. By contrast, there were 12 EU Member States where less than 1.0 % of the adult population in the first income quintile reported that the principal reason why they had unmet medical needs was because care was too expensive. A similar analysis for the top income quintile in 2019 reveals that Greece also had the highest share (0.8 %) of this subpopulation with unmet medical needs because care was too expensive; Romania (0.7 %) was the only other EU Member State where more than 0.5 % of the top income quintile reported unmet medical needs due to such care being too expensive. By contrast, 0.0 % of the adults in the top income quintile reported unmet medical needs primarily because care was too expensive in 14 Member States. Although not usually life-threatening, dental conditions may result in excruciating pain, while untreated dental problems may have longer-term detrimental effects on both an individualas health and well-being. In 2019, the share of the EU-27 population aged 16 years and over reporting that the high cost/expense of dental care had resulted in unmet dental care needs was 2.5 % a about 2.8 times the corresponding share for unmet medical needs due to reasons of expense. This may reflect some people giving a higher priority to their medical needs rather than their dental needs and may also be affected by the relatively high level of dental care costs in some EU Member States, in comparison to medical costs which are often (entirely) paid for / reimbursed by social security systems. The share of the population with unmet dental needs primarily due to the cost/expense of treatment ranged from less than 1.0 % in nine EU Member States (with the lowest share being 0.2 %, recorded in Malta) to 8.6 % in Greece, 9.6 % in Portugal and 9.8 % in Latvia. Some 5.5 % of the EU-27as adult population in the lowest income quintile had unmet dental needs in 2019 due to the cost/expense of treatment, compared with 0.6 % of the EU-27 adult population in the top income quintile. Across the EU Member States, people in the bottom income quintile were considerably more likely to have unmet dental needs than their fellow residents in the uppermost income quintile. In Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden, 0.0 % of the adult population in the uppermost (fifth) income quintile had unmet dental needs. Large differences in the amount of money households spent on healthcare National accounts provide information about household consumption expenditure on goods and services. This information may be analysed according to the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP). Division 06 of this classification covers health, including expenditure on: medical products, appliances and equipment; outpatient services; hospital services. On average, a710 were spent on health per inhabitant in the EU-27 in 2019 (see Map 1 ). There were large differences in the level of expenditure in 2019 between EU Member States, from lows in Slovakia (a230 per inhabitant) and Czechia (a250 per inhabitant) up to a1000 or more per inhabitant in Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium (where the highest value was recorded, averaging a1350 per inhabitant). These variations reflect, to some degree, the different provisions for the delivery of healthcare across the EU Member States: on the one hand, there are some characterised by predominantly public systems financed through taxation, where healthcare is provided free at the point of use; others are characterised by social premium payments, whereby patients usually pay their medical bills and are later reimbursed by government. In the Member States where healthcare provision tends to be provided free at the point of use, it is more commonplace to find that expenditure per inhabitant on health was relatively low.

                                          Childcare and education arrangements The unequal division of household tasks/duties a including those linked to raising children a is often presented as a key factor when explaining why female employment rates are lower than those recorded for men. This division of tasks may have other implications, such as the gender pay gap or a lack of female participation in social and/or political activities. Almost half of all children under three years of age were cared for only by their parents In 2019, close to half (47.1%) of all children in the EU who were aged less than three years were cared for exclusively by their parents ( see Figure 1 ). This share varied considerably across the EU Member States, from a low of 21.2 % in the Netherlands and 22.6 % in Portugal, up to over 60.0 % in Croatia (60.8 %) in Slovakia (61.2 %) and Latvia (63.8 %), reaching its peak with 69.9 % in Bulgaria. More than one third of children aged less than three years in the EU received formal childcare Children who are not cared for exclusively by their parents may receive formal childcare, other types of childcare, or both. Formal childcare is defined here as regulated childcare provided away from the childas home; it includes, among other things, the time spent at school within compulsory education. Other types of childcare comprise care that is provided by a professional child-minder at the childas home or at the child-mindersa home as well as care provided by grandparents, other household members (outside parents), other relatives, friends or neighbours. In 2019, more than one third (35.3 %) of children in the EU aged less than three years received formal childcare; just over one fifth (21.5 %) of children in this age group received 30 hours or more of formal childcare per week, which was significantly higher than the share (13.8 %) receiving less than 30 hours per week. Among the EU Member States, the share of children aged less than three years receiving at least one hour of formal childcare per week in 2019 peaked at 66.0 % in Denmark. As well as in Denmark, at least half of all children aged less than three years received some formal childcare in the Netherlands (64.8 %), Luxembourg (60.0 %), Spain (57.4 %), Belgium (55.5 %), Sweden (53.1 %), Portugal (52.9 %) and France (50.8 %) a see Table 1 The share of children in the EU that received formal childcare increased according to their age. In 2019, the share of children aged between three years and the minimum compulsory school age receiving some formal childcare was 89.6 %, while it reached 96.7 % among children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years of age. In 2019, Croatia (56.9 %) and Poland (61.3 %) were the only EU Member States to report that only around three fifths of children aged between three years and the minimum compulsory school age received some formal childcare. By contrast, more than 95.0 % of all children in the Netherlands, France, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain and Belgium in this age group received such care. Given that formal childcare includes compulsory education, it is not surprising to find that at least 9 out of 10 children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years received some formal childcare in 2019 in nearly all of the EU Member States: the only exceptions were Romania (87.0 %) and Germany (88.6 %). In addition, Serbia and North Macedonia recorded figures well below 90 %, with 81.8 % and 75.5 % respectively. Around a quarter of all children in the EU under the age of three years received other types of childcare Table 2 provides information in relation to the provision of other types of childcare, with the same analysis by age and duration of childcare as presented in Table 1. In 2019, around one quarter (25.9 %) of all children in the EU under the age of three years received other types of childcare; as such, these types of childcare were somewhat less common than formal childcare (35.3 %). More than two fifths of all children under the age of three years received other types of childcare in Czechia (40.3 %), Greece (41.9 %), Hungary (43.3 %), and Romania where the highest share was recorded, at 53.4 %. For children in the EU between the age of three years and the minimum compulsory school age, the share receiving other types of childcare was comparable to that recorded for children under the age of three years; this share stood at 25.0 % in 2019. A slightly lower share (21.9 %) of children aged between the minimum compulsory school age and 12 years received other types of childcare.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                         Number of seaborne passengers reaches 419 million The number of passengers passing through EU ports increased by 1.8 % between 2018 and 2019, reaching a peak of 418.8 million (Figure 1). After falling regularly between 2008 and 2014, with an exception in 2013 (+0.3 % compared to 2012), the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports recovered in the last five years to reach higher levels than in 2008, which was the previous peak observed (+2.3 % in 2019 compared with 2008). Unlike movements of goods, where broadly 60 % of goods are unloaded and 40 % loaded in the EU ports, the difference between the number of passengers disembarking (\"inwards\") and embarking (\"outwards\") in EU ports is generally small. This reflects the fact that seaborne passenger transport in Europe is mainly carried by national or intra-EU ferry services, with the same passengers being counted twice in the port throughput statistics (once when they embark the ferry in one EU port and once when they disembark the same ferry in another EU port). At 86.5 million and 73.9 million seaborne passengers, respectively, Italian and Greek ports accounted for a combined share of 38.5 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019 (Figure 2). As a consequence, Italy and Greece remained the main countries in terms of EU seaborne passenger transport. The two leading countries were followed by Denmark with 44.2 million passengers embarking and disembarking in 2019, Spain (34.6 million) and Croatia (34.1 million). Compared to the previous year, the largest relative increases in seaborne passengers transport were recorded by Cyprus (+89.3 % from a low base), Bulgaria (+60.9 % from a low base), Portugal (+8.6 %), Spain and Slovenia (both +6.3 %) and Lithuania (+6.2 %) in 2019. The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial growth in 2019 compared to the previous year (+16.6 %). In contrast, only four EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018. The largest decrease was observed in France (-4.1 %), followed by Belgium (-3.1 %), Ireland (-2.3 %) and Finland (-0.2 %). The candidate country Montenegro and the United Kingdom also registered substantial falls in 2019 compared to 2018 (-9.9 % and -4.4 % respectively). Number of seaborne cruise passengers increased to 15 million The number of cruise passengers passing through EU ports increased by 8.6 % between 2018 and 2019, to 14.9 million. Although cruise passengers made up only 3.6 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019, these passengers play an important role in the ports and countries where the cruise traffic is concentrated. Close to 78 % of the total number of cruise passengers embarking and disembarking in EU ports in 2019 did so in the ports of one of the three countries Italy, Spain, Germany (Figure 3). Cruise passengers on day excursions in EU ports are not included in these figures. With 5.0 million cruise passengers, Italy was the main contributor to the EU seaborne cruise passenger traffic (34 %). Italy was followed by Spain with 3.9 million cruise passengers embarking and disembarking in 2019 and Germany (2.6 million). The United Kingdom also registered a substantial number of cruise passengers with 2.2 million. Compared to the previous year, only two EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: Belgium (-1.4 %) and France (-1.1 %). In contrast, many EU Member States registered substantial increases in 2019 compared to 2018. The three main countries in terms of cruise passengers reported relatively substantial increases: Germany (+13.1 %), Spain (+10.4 %) and Italy (+4.0 %). Messina was the largest European passenger port in 2019 The top 20 passenger ports accounted for close to 36 % of the total number of passengers embarking and disembarking in the reporting countries in 2019. The port of Dover, with a 7.0 % decrease in 2019 compared to 2018, lost its position as the largest European passenger port to the benefit of Messina and Helsinki. Messina, which registered a 10.0 % increase in the number of passengers embarking and disembarking from 2018 to 2019 took over the first place, while Helsinki remained in second place, putting Dover in third place (Figure 4). The top 20 passenger ports were the same in 2018 and 2019. However, the position of these ports in the ranking changed for 16 of them. In particular, the port of Napoli gained 5 positions in the ranking, after a 31.0 % increase in 2019 compared to 2018, putting it in 7th place. After Napoli, the port of Reggio di Calabria recorded the largest relative increase between 2018 and 2019 (+16.6 %). In contrast, in addition to Dover, five other ports registered a decrease in 2019 compared to 2018; the most noticeable being for Calais (-7.0 %). Most EU seaborne passenger transport is within national borders Table 1 and Figure 5 show the breakdown of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport between national, international intra-EU and international extra-EU transport for each reporting country. Unlike the other statistics presented in this article, these figures do not reflect the sum of embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in ports, but estimate the transport of passengers between ports. As far as possible, double-counting of the same passengers being reported as embarking in one port and disembarking in another port within the same statistical aggregate is excluded in these figures (see data sources). At 220 million, the EU seaborne transport of passengers (excluding cruise passengers) remained stable between 2018 and 2019 (+0.1 %) (Table 1). Compared to the previous year, only five EU Member States recorded decreases in 2019 compared to 2018: the most noticeable being for Belgium (-6.3 %) and France (-4.8 %). The candidate country Montenegro registered a substantial fall of 10.2 %. In contrast, the main growths from 2018 to 2019 were recorded for Lithuania (+6.2 %) and Portugal (+6.0 %). The candidate country Turkey also registered a substantial increase of 29.8 %. The majority of the seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in the EU is carried out between ports located in the same country (63 %), reflecting the dominant role of national ferry services in the EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport (Figure 5). In general, countries with busy ferry connections to and from well-populated islands will have both a large volume of seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport and a high share of national maritime passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport. This applies to the two leading maritime passenger countries, Italy and Greece, as well as countries like Portugal, Croatia and Spain. Countries with ferry connections to other EU countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, naturally have high shares of international intra-EU transport. Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Spain recorded the highest shares of extra-EU seaborne passenger (excluding cruise passengers) transport in 2019, with Spain having ferry links with Morocco and the other countries with the United Kingdom.  \n",

                                       Structural profile Around 1 in 10 (8.9 %) of all enterprises in the EU as non-financial business economy (Sections B to J and L to N and Division 95) were classified to manufacturing (Section C) in 2018, a total of more than 2.0 million enterprises. The manufacturing sector employed 29.9 million persons in 2018 and generated EUR 1944 billion of value added. By these two measures, manufacturing was the second largest of the NACE sections within the EUas non-financial business economy in terms of its contribution to employment (23.1 %) and the largest contributor to non-financial business economy value added, accounting for more than one quarter of the total (29.7 %). In 2018, the EUas manufacturing sector recorded apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs above non-financial business economy averages: the apparent labour productivity of the manufacturing sector was EUR 65000 per person employed, some EUR 14300 more than the non-financial business economy average (EUR 50700 per person employed), while average personnel costs in the manufacturing sector were EUR 42800 per employee, some EUR 7300 above the non-financial business economy average (EUR 35500 per employee). Combining these two ratios into the wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio shows that value added per person employed in the EUas manufacturing sector was equivalent to 152.0 % of average personnel costs per employee, which was slightly above the average for the non-financial business economy (143.0 %). The gross operating rate (the relation between the gross operating surplus and turnover ) was 9.6 % for the EUas manufacturing sector in 2018, below the 10.2 % average for the non-financial business economy, and as such this sector had the second lowest level of profitability (using this measure) among any of the NACE sections within the non-financial business economy, with only distributive trades recording a lower gross operating rate (5.4 %). Sectoral analysis At the NACE division level the manufacturing sector is composed of 24 different subsectors. The largest EU subsectors in 2018 in terms of value added were the manufacture of machinery and equipment (Division 28) and manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (Division 29), while in terms of employment manufacture of food products (Division 10) and the manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment (Division 25) were the largest a see Figure 1. Manufacturing subsectors are very diverse, combining activities with relatively low apparent labour productivity and average personnel costs, such as the manufacture of wearing apparel (Division 14), of leather and related products (Division 15), wood and of products of wood and cork (Division 16), furniture (Division 31), and textiles (Division 13), with other activities that have considerably higher values for the same indicators, such as manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations (Division 21), of coke and refined petroleum products (Division 19) and the manufacture of tobacco products (Division 12)nbsp;see Table 2b. In 2018, apparent labour productivity within the EUas manufacturing subsectors ranged from EUR 22000 per person employed or more for the manufacture of wearing apparel, to EUR 186000 per person employed for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations.In line with their very low apparent labour productivity, the manufacture of wearing apparel and of furniture recorded the lowest average personnel costs in the EUas manufacturing sector, at EUR 17800 per employee and EUR 26000 per employee respectively. Average personnel costs per employee were EUR 73000 per employee for the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations, the highest among the manufacturing subsectors and second highest subsector within all of the non-financial economy subsectors. This subsector also recorded second highest apparent labour productivity among NACE divisions within the whole of the non-financial business economy and together with manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products recorded the highest wage-adjusted labour productivity ratio among manufacturing subsectors.On the other side, repair and installation of machinery and equipment (Division 33) recorded the lowest (117.0 %) a see Table 2b. An analysis of the EUas gross operating surplus (value added less personnel costs) gives an idea of the operating profit before depreciation charges. The highest gross operating surplus were recorded for the manufacture of tobacco products and manufacture of beverages equivalent to 14.1 % and 13.9 % of turnover respectively. The remaining subsectors mainly recorded gross operating rates between 6.2 % for the manufacture of other transport equipment (Division 30) and 11.6 % for the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (Division 23). The one exception was the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products which had a gross operating rate of 4.1 %, its low rate explained, in part, by the capital-intensive nature and relatively high turnover of this transformation activity. Country overview Because of the tradable (export and import) nature of manufactured goods it follows that the relative importance of manufacturing within the non-financial business economy varies greatly between EU Member States and also that specialisations at the subsector level are sometimes very pronounced. Figure 2 shows that the share of manufacturing within the non-financial business economyas value added varied in 2018 from 11.9 % in Luxembourg and 12.6 % in Cyprus to more than 37.0 % of the total in Slovakia and Czechia, with Ireland having the highest share (45.0 %). The range in employment terms was similar, from 11.9 % in the Netherlands to 35.1 % in Czechia. Among the five largest EU Member States, Germany stood out as its manufacturing sector contributed to one third (33.4 %) of the EUas value added in 2018, above its 28.3 % share of value added in the EUas non-financial business economy as a whole. Italy also recorded a larger share (12.7 %) of the value added generated in the EUas manufacturing sector than it did for the non-financial business economy as a whole (11.5 %), while the reverse was true for France, Spain and the Netherlands. Size class analysis Large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) contributed more to the EUas manufacturing sector than is typical for the non-financial business economy as a whole a in 2018, some 64.6 % of the manufacturing sectoras value added was generated by large enterprises and these employed 47.6 % of the manufacturing employment; for comparison, the non-financial business economy average for large enterprise was a 47.2 % share of value added and a 35.1 % share of the employment. The contribution of large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) to EU value added in 2018 was concentrated in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, tobacco products and of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations. The contribution of medium-sized enterprises (employing 50 to 249 persons) to EU value added in 2018 was highest (across the manufacturing sector) in rubber and plastic products, textiles, leather and related products and fabricated metal products except machinery and equipment.In the manufacture of leather and related products, small enterprises (employing 10 to 49 persons) contributed 29.4 % of the subsectorsa value added. Micro enterprises (employing fewer than 10 persons) contributed to the largest share of value added among the four size classes in manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials (29.4 %) and repair and installation of machinery and equipment (28.1 %) a as shown in Figure 6.  \n",

General and regional statistics; Economy and finance; Population and social conditions; Industry, trade and services; Agriculture and fisheries; International trade; Transport; Environment and energy; Science, technology and digital society. For each of these themes, the user is presented with a range of different subthemes. These subthemes are presented through adedicated sectionsa on each subject area, with links to information for data (main tables and databases), legislation, methodology, publications and other background information. Access to data Data navigation tree The majority of Eurostatas statistics may be accessed from the data navigation tree ; alternatively, click on aData &gt; Databasea in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. The data navigation tree is based on the nine statistical themes presented above and is collapsible and expandable. It has four main branches: Database by themes which contains the full range of public data available on Eurostatas website. These data are presented in multi-dimensional tables with selection features that allow tailor-made presentations and extractions. The interface for databases is called the Data browser and this provides an intuitive way to select and organise information. Data can be downloaded from the Data browser in various formats (XLS, CSV and TSV). Tables by themes which offers a selection of the most important Eurostat data in a user-friendly way. Techical aspects are the same as for \"Database by themes\". Tables on EU policy which also provides access to pre-defined main tables; these have particular relevance for tracking the progress being made in relation to important policy areas, including: the macroeconomic imbalances procedure indicators ; the euro-indicators / principal European economic indicators a PEEIs ; the Europe 2020 indicators; the circular economy indicators; the sustainable development indicators; the Employment and social policy indicators; and the indicators for the European pillar of social rights. The tools for viewing and extracting data are the same as those described above for tables by themes. The fourth branch was created to present some cross-cutting topics, and currently contains data coming from different data sources on the quality of life, migrant integration and children in migration, economic globalisation indicators, equality (age and gender), quality of employment, agri-environmental indicators, climate change and skills-related statistics. The data navigation tree also has two special branches, where new items or recently updated items (from all databases and main tables) can be displayed according to a number of criteria set by the user. Online data codes Eurostat online data codes, such as tps00001 and nama_gdp_c [1], allow easy access to the most recent data on Eurostatas website; these codes are given as part of the source below each table, figure or map. Users can access the freshest data by typing a standardised hyperlink into a web browser a https:/ /ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product' code=&lt;data_code&gt;&amp;mode=view a where &lt;data_code&gt; is to be replaced by the online data code printed under the table or figure in question. The data are presented either in the TGM or the Data explorer interface. Online data codes can also be fed into the aSearcha function on Eurostatas website, which is presented in the top right-hand corner of most Eurostat webpages. The results from such a search present related dataset(s), publications, euro indicators, news articles, dedicated sections and other information. By clicking on these hyperlinks users are taken to the appropriate dedicated section or to product page(s). Note that the data on Eurostatas website are frequently updated. Visualisation tools Several data visualisation tools provide users with interactive web applications. They are available from the Eurostat website. Publications Eurostat produces a variety of publications. All publications are available free-of-charge in from Eurostatas website. A a Publications a tab is accessible from the top menu bar on Eurostatas website. Eurostatas publications programme consists of several collections: Flagship publications (paper or digital) addressing themes highly relevant for stakeholder. Examples are the Eurostat Regional yearbook and The EU in the World. Interactive publications are digital publications containing short texts, dynamic infographics, maps, videos, graphs, photos, etc. Examples are Housing in Europe and Regions in Europe - statistics visualised. Key figures is a series of publications providing short texts and static visulisations giving an overview of a subject. Examples are Key figures on Europe and Key figures on European business. Manuals and guidelines describe methodologies, guidelines and standards which are actually applied in the European Statistical System (ESS). Statistical working papers present on-going statistical methodological developments and applied statistical studies. Statistical reports are quality reports or other papers introducing new or experimental data in one statistical area. Compact guides are leaflets promoting a statistical domain. Statistics Explained Statistics Explained provides easy access to statistical information concerning the EU. It can be accessed from the homepage of the Eurostat website as well as from the right-hand frame of most dedicated sections. Statistics Explained is an online publishing system about EU statistics which uses MediaWiki technology and resembles Wikipedia. It is a collaborative platform that is used to present statistical articles which together form an encyclopaedia of European statistics, completed by a glossary of the statistical concepts and terms used. In addition, numerous links are provided to the latest data and metadata and to further information, making Statistics Explained a portal for regular and occasional users alike. Statistics Explained pages in English consists of some 700 statistical articles presenting data, 200 background articles on methodological practices or developments, and some 1900 glossary pages defining or explaining terms; these numbers are continuously growing. Reference metadata Metadata dissemination Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX) content oriented guidelines were adopted in January 2009 by seven international organisations: the Euro SDMX metadata structure (ESMS) is a format based on these. ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData &gt; Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading. User support Eurostat and the other members of the ESS have set up a system of user support centres. These exist for nearly all of the EUas official languages and for a range of languages spoken in the EFTA, candidate countries and potential candidates. In order to offer the best possible and personalised support, requests should, whenever possible, be addressed to the relevant language support centre. The mission of each centre is to provide free-of-charge help and guidance to persons having difficulty in finding the statistical data they require. Contact information for these user support centres is available via the a Help a tab on Eurostatas website. Eurostatas service for journalists Statistics make news and they are essential to many reports, features and in-depth analyses. Printed media, as well as radio, television and online information services, use Eurostat data intensively. Eurostatas press office publishes euro indicators on a key selection of data covering the EU, the euro area, the EU Member States and their partners.

       "      <td>Introduction The AES provides an overview of the participation of individuals in education and training (i.e. formal and non-formal education and training as well as informal learning). The reference period for the participation in the learning activities is the twelve months prior to the interview. The survey focuses on people aged 25-64. A pilot survey took place around the year 2007 and starting from the 2011 survey the AES is carried out every five years. The following information is available from the AES: Participation in formal education, non-formal education and training and informal learning (respectively labelled FE, NFE and INF); Access to information on learning possibilities; Time spent on education and training; Characteristics of the learning activities; Reasons for not participating; Obstacles to participation; Employer financing and costs of learning; Self-reported language skills. Comparable data from 2007, 2011 and 2016 AES can be found in the following folders of the database: Participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m0); Participation in informal learning (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m4); Access to information on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m1); Time spent on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m2); Obstacles to participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m3); Self-reported language skills (educ_lang_00). Coverage and mandate Three waves of the AES have been implemented so far. The first AES (2007 AES) was a pilot survey conducted in 26 EU Member States (Ireland and Luxembourg did not participate), as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Tukey. This first wave was carried out based on a gentlemenas agreement between 2005 and 2008 (depending on the country). The second wave (2011 AES) was conducted in 27 EU Member States (Croatia did not participate), Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia and Turkey between July 2011 and June 2012. This statistical operation was for the first time conducted under the institutional mandate set in Regulation 452/2008, and implemented by Regulation 823/2010. This legal basis establishes the collection of data on the participation of adults (aged 25a64) in learning activities every five years. The third wave (2016 AES) was conducted in 28 EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between July 2016 and March 2017. Regulation 1175/2014 provided the implementation details of this wave. Further information on each wave is available in the reference metadata and in the implementation manuals. Basic concepts Lifelong learning encompasses all learning activities undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences, within personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or aim to learn is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sporting activities. Adult learning means the participation of adults in lifelong learning. Adult learning usually refers to learning activities after the end of initial education. The participation rate in education and training covers participation in both formal and non-formal education and training. Learning activities are any activities of an individual organised with the intention to improve their knowledge, skills, and competences. There are two fundamental criteria that distinguish learning activities from non-learning activities: they must be intentional and organised. Intentional learning (as opposed to random learning) is defined as a deliberate search for knowledge, skills or competences or attitudes of lasting value. Organised learning is defined as learning planned in a pattern or sequence with explicit or implicit aims. The learning activities are defined within a classification named classification of learning activities (CLA). The current version of the CLA (2016 edition) is aligned with ISCED 2011. The 2016 edition of the CLA applies to the 2016 AES. 2007 and 2011 AES refer to the 2006 edition of the CLA; however, data between the waves are overall comparable. The CLA defines three main types of learning activities as follows: Formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned through public organisations and recognised private bodies, and - in their totality - constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education or equivalent authorities, e.g. any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub-national education authorities. Formal education consists mostly of initial education [...]. Vocational education, special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system. Qualifications from formal education are by definition recognised and, therefore, are within the scope of ISCED. Institutionalised education occurs when an organisation provides structured educational arrangements, such as student-teacher relationships and/or interactions, that are specially designed for education and learninga. [1] Non-formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided in order to guarantee the right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a continuous pathway structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity; and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Nevertheless, formal, recognised qualifications may be obtained through exclusive participation in specific non-formal education programmes; this often happens when the non-formal programme completes the competencies obtained in another contexta. [2] Informal learning is aintentional, but it is less organised and less structured... and may include for example learning events (activities) that occur in the family, in the workplace, and in the daily life of every person, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis.a [3] Job-related non-formal education and training : the respondent takes part in the non-formal education and training activity in order to obtain knowledge and/or learn new skills needed for a current or future job, to increase earnings, to improve job and/or career opportunities in a current or another field and generally to improve his/her opportunities for advancement and promotion. Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal education and training : all job-related non-formal education and training activities paid at least partially by the employer and/or done during paid working hours. Usual breakdowns and classifications Educational attainment level Educational attainment level is the highest level of education successfully completed by an individual. Educational attainment is classified according to the International standard classification of education (ISCED). This classification allows for international comparability between the different national education systems, introducing criteria to categorise the education levels into a common nomenclature. It therefore facilitates comparisons across countries based on uniform and internationally agreed definitions. The successful completion of an education programme must be validated by a recognised qualification, i.e. a qualification officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance. When determining the highest level, both general and vocational education should be taken into consideration. 2016 AES was classified according to ISCED 2011; 2007 and 2011 AES were classified under ISCED 1997. The AES data dissemination considers three broad levels of aggregation: Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education (levels 0 to 2 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 0, 1 and 2 but also include level 3C short (educational attainment from ISCED level 3 programmes of less than two years); Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (levels 3 and 4 of ISCED 2011). ISCED 2011 level 3 programmes of partial level completion are considered within ISCED level 3. Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 3C long, 3A, 3B and 4; Tertiary education (levels 5 to 8 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 5 and 6. Occupation Occupation is defined as the task and duties undertaken by each worker in their job. The International standard classification of occupations (ISCO) organises jobs into a clearly defined set of groups. 2011 and 2016 AES were classified according to ISCO-08; 2007 AES was classified under ISCO-COM 88. Data are directly comparable for the categories shown online. Four categories of employee occupations are distinguished in the online tables on occupation: Managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals; Clerical support workers, service and sales workers; Skilled manual workers; and Elementary occupations. Foreign languages - level of self-reported knowledge The knowledge of foreign languages is self-reported by the respondents and is categorised in three levels in the 2011 AES questionnaire. The labels displayed in the online tables of domain educ_lang_00 correspond to the following self-reported knowledge: Fair : I can understand and use the most common everyday expressions. I use the language in relation to familiar things and situations; Good : I can understand the essential of clear language and produce simple text. I can describe experiences and events and communicate fairly fluently; and Proficient : I can understand a wide range of demanding texts and use the language flexibly. I master the language almost completely. In the 2007 and 2016 AES, a fourth a basic a level was included in the questionnaire: aI only understand and can use a few wordsa. In the online tables that fourth category is included in the category a fair a. Degree of urbanisation Three types of areas are defined based on population density: cities : at least 50% of the population lives in urban centres; towns and suburbs : at least 50% of the population lives in urban clusters and less than 50% of the population lives in urban centres; rural areas : at least 50% of the population lives in rural grid cells. Questionnaire The 2016 AES European standard questionnaire has the following structure: 1.0 - General information 1.1 - Information on the household 1.2 - Information on the individual 1.3 - Access to information about learning possibilities 1.4 - Participation in education and training 1.5 - Difficulties in participation in education 1.6 - Informal learning 1.7 - Languages 1.8 - Household income National questionnaires a which are based on the standard questionnaire for the sake of cross-country comparability a are available on this link.

       "      <td>Participation rate of adults in learning in the last four weeks The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training adopted in May 2009 had set a number of benchmarks to be achieved by 2020, including one for adult participation in learning, namely that an average of at least 15 % of adults aged 25 to 64 years old should participate in lifelong learning. In 2020, the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 in the EU who participated in education or training was 9.2 %; a share that was 0.9 percentage points lower than the corresponding share for 2015 and 1.6 points lower compared to 2019. It is considered that part of the decrease could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. cancellation of training activities. The adult learning indicator refers to participation in formal and non-formal education and training and the reference period for the participation is the four weeks preceding the interview as is usual in the labour force survey. (see Table 1). Denmark, Finland and Sweden stood out from the other EU Member States as they reported considerably higher proportions of their respective adult populations participating in lifelong learning in the four weeks preceding the interview, ranging from 20.0 % to 28.6 %. Estonia, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were the only other Member States where the participation rate in 2020 exceeded the 15 % benchmark. By contrast, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia and Poland reported adult learning rates of less than 4.0 %. The proportion of the population who had participated in adult learning was higher among women (10.0 % in 2020) in the EU than among men (8.3 %); the shares for men and women were both lower in 2020 than they had been five years earlier. The participation rate of both women and men increased continuously until 2019 and fell in 2020 only, i.e. with the onset of the COVID-2019 pandemic. In 2020, women recorded higher participation rates than men in all EU Member States except for Czechia, Germany, Greece and Cyprus (where rates for men were higher), while Romania reported the same rate for both sexes. The largest gender difference, in percentage points, was in Sweden, where the participation rate for women was 13.6 percentage points higher than for men. Participation rate of adults in learning in the last 12 months In addition to the data from the labour force survey which provides information on participation in education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey interview, information on education and training is available from the adult education survey (AES). The AES measures participation in learning activities with a longer reference period (12 months preceding the survey interview) and therefore is likely to cover more learning activities, resulting in higher participation rates in formal and non-formal education and training. However, it is carried out less frequently (from 2016 every six years). The most recent wave of the survey was conducted between July 2016 and March 2017 (and named the 2016 AES). According to this survey, in 201643.7 % of people in the EU aged 25 to 64 took part in education and training (during the 12 months preceding the interview), the majority of which participating in non-formal education and training (see Figure 1). For the EU as a whole, participation rates in education and training in the 12 months preceding the interview were almost the same for men and women. In Cyprus, Czechia, Hungary and Italy, men were considerably more likely than women to have participated in education and training, whereas the reverse was true in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Lithuania (see Table 2). An analysis by age shows that the participation of younger persons (aged 25a34) in the EU was more than 20 percentage points higher than that of older ones (aged 55a64) in 2016. Participation in education and training among older persons was particularly low in Romania and Greece. The likelihood of participation in education and training was related to the level of educational achievement: persons with a tertiary level education reported the highest participation rates (64.5 % for the EU in 2016), while those having completed at most lower secondary education were the least likely to have participated (22.9 %). Providers of non-formal education and training activities Employers were the most common providers of non-formal education and training activities, providing more than one third (33.7 %) of such activities in the EU according to the 2016 adult education survey (see Table 3). Employers provided almost two thirds of non-formal education and training in Bulgaria, and three fifths of such activities in Hungary. Among the less common providers of non-formal education and training in the EU as a whole, the relative importance of non-formal education and training institutions was particularly high in Poland (48.7 %) and Slovenia (36.7 %), formal education institutions were frequent providers in Lithuania and Finland, and commercial institutions (where education and training is not the main activity) in Sweden (see Table 3). Participation in informal learning activities Next to information on participation in formal and non-formal education and training, the adult education survey also collects information on informal learning. Typical forms of informal learning are taught learning via coaching or guided visits to e.g. museums. Informal learning can also take place as non-taught learning, e.g. as self-learning or as learning in a group with friends or colleagues. In 2016, 59.7 % of adults aged 25-64 in the EU reported participation in any informal learning in the 12 months preceding the interview (see Table 4). Participation in informal learning ranged from below 35 % in Lithuania and Poland to over 90 % in Croatia and Cyprus. In the majority of countries women were more likely than men to participate in this type of learning. Not very surprisingly, informal learning by using a computer (or similar devices) is reported to be the most frequent form of informal learning in most countries.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Formal and non-formal adult education and training About 44 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in some form of education or training Among adults of working age (25a64), 43.7 % across the EU took part in formal or non-formal education or training in 2016. This marked an increase of 3.5 percentage points compared with the previous survey, which was conducted in 2011, when 40.2 % of the working-age population had participated in formal or non-formal education or training. In 2007, this share was 32.8 %. In 2016, the majority of the non-formal education and training that was undertaken in the EU by people aged 25a64 was job-related rather than for personal fulfilment. Training courses, seminars, conferences and guided-on-the-job training are key elements for providing job-related training; while the latter type is usually very short, the other types tend to be of a slightly longer duration (typically one or two days). Guided-on-the-job training is characterised by planned periods of training, instruction or practical experience, using normal tools of work, either at the immediate place of work or in the work-situation with the presence of a tutor. In the Netherlands and Sweden, the share of the working-age population participating in education and training rose to 64 % Among the EU Member States, there was a considerable variation between the shares of adult working-age populations who participated in formal and non-formal education or training. In 2016, the highest proportions were recorded in the Netherlands (64.1 %) and Sweden (63.8 %), while 50a60 % of working-age adults in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Finland, Hungary and Austria participated in some form of education and training. A small majority, 16 of the Member States recorded participation rates between 25 and 50 %, while Greece (16.7 %) and Romania (7.0 %) recorded much lower participation rates (see Figure 1). Adult education and training by field of study An analysis of the instruction hours spent by field of study reveals that in 2016 less than one fifth (17.5 %) of the formal and non-formal education and training that was given to adults aged 25a64 in the EU concerned business, administration and law. There were two fields of study which each accounted for around 15 % of the total hours spent by adults in instruction: services; and health and welfare. Arts and humanities; and engineering, manufacturing and construction were the only other fields to record double-digit shares. Business, administration &amp; law and health &amp; welfare accounted for the biggest shares of adult education and training Table 1 highlights that, while business, administration and law was the most popular field of study in terms of hours spent for adult education and training in the EU in 2016, with eight Member States recording their highest shares in this domain, health and welfare was just behind with seven Member States. Among the other Member States, five recorded highest shares in services, four in arts and humanities and two in engineering, manufacturing and construction (Estonia registering its highest share in both health &amp; welfare and engineering, manufacturing and construction). The remaining two countries recorded high non response. Adult education and training: relative importance of formal and non-formal instruction Non-formal instruction is the most frequent type of education and training The majority of adult education and training in the EU is non-formal education and training, in other words, outside of formal institutions of schools, colleges and universities. This is not surprising given that the age criterion for the AES is persons of working age (25a64 years-old), when most people have already completed their formal studies. In 2016, more than two fifths (41.4 %) of the EUas adult working-age population participated in non-formal education and training, a share that was more than eight times as high as the share of those who participated in formal education or training (5.0 %). Formal education and training was relatively common in Finland (14.2 % of working-age adults), Sweden (13.8 %) and Denmark (13.5 %); all of the remaining EU Member States reported single-digit shares. By contrast, fewer than 3 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in formal education and training in Bulgaria, Czechia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia (see Figure 1). A higher proportion of the instruction given in health and welfare was provided in a formal setting, while the opposite was true for services Figure 3 provides an analysis of the relative importance of different fields of study in terms of instruction hours, contrasting formal and non-formal education and training. In 2016, health and welfare accounted for 18.8 % of the total number of hours adults spent in formal education and training in the EU compared with 11.5 % of hours spent in non-formal education and training. Engineering, manufacturing and construction accounted also for a considerably higher proportion of the formal instruction hours of adults in the EU in 2016 (when compared with its share of non-formal instruction hours), while the relative share of services in non-formal instruction hours was considerably higher than its share in formal instruction hours. In a similar vein, social sciences, journalism and information as well as natural sciences, mathematics and statistics accounted for a relatively high share of the total number of hours of formal instruction that were given to adults, while arts and humanities, Information and Communication Technologies and generic programmes and qualifications accounted for relatively high shares of the total number of hours of non-formal education and training. Focus on non-formal adult education and training The remainder of this article concentrates on the most common type of adult learning, non-formal education and training. The AES provides information on basically all non-formal learning activities in which an adult participated during the last 12 months. Therefore it is possible to analyse at the level of non-formal activities. The shares presented in this section are generally shown in relation to the total number of non-formal activities. Formal education and training of adults is not covered hereafter. Relative importance of job-related non-formal adult education and training In 2016, approximately four fifths (78.8 %) of the non-formal education and training activities of adults in the EU were job-related and almost one fifth (19.4 %) was not job-related; the remaining 1.8 % concerned non-formal activities where there was no response whether it was job-related or not. The share of non-formal learning activities that was job-related ranged among the EU Member States from highs of more than 90 % in Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, down to 55.6 % in Hungary (see Table 2). A higher proportion of non-formal learning activities of adult men rather than adult women was job-related Within the EU in 2016, a high proportion (83.2 %) of non-formal learning activities of men was job-related. This share could be compared with the corresponding value for women, where just below three quarters (74.6 %) of all non-formal learning activities were job-related. This gender gap was apparent in 26 EU Member States. The only exception was Cyprus, where the share of job-related non-formal learning activities was higher for women than for men: 79.3 % against 66.3 %. In contrast, while 90.5 % of the non-formal learning activities of men in Greece were job-related, the corresponding share for women was 17.0 percentage points lower. This was the largest gender gap among the EU Member States, ahead of Italy (14.8 points difference), while France, Czechia and Malta all reported double-digit differences (again with a higher share of non-formal learning activities of adult men being job-related). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to become slightly higher as people moved towards the 45a54 years age group In 2016, the share of non-formal learning activities in the EU that was job-related rose slightly as a function of age from 77.3 % for those aged 25a34 to a peak of 81.7 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 71.8 % among those aged 55a64. While considerably more than half of the non-formal learning of people aged 55a64 continued to be job-related, the relatively low shares for this age group suggest that some older persons were preparing for retirement by expanding their knowledge or skills in non-job related areas (see Figure 4). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to be higher among adults with a tertiary level of educational attainment An analysis by level of educational attainment (see Figure 4) suggests that adults in the EU with a tertiary level of educational attainment were more likely to follow some form of job-related education and training. In 2016, some 79.8 % of the non-formal learning activities of people aged 25a64 with a tertiary level of educational attainment (ISCED 2011 levels 5 to 8) were job-related, compared with 74.1 % among those with a low level of educational attainment (ISCED levels 0-2). At the same time, for adults with an intermediate educational attainment (ISCED levels 3-4) a share almost as high as for those with a tertiary education can be observed (78.6 %). Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal adult education and training Figure 5 shows the relative contribution of sponsorship from employers to job-related non-formal education and training. In 2016, some 68.4 % of the non-formal education and training activities of adults were job-related and sponsored by employers, while 10.4 % of the activities were job-related and financially supported by other means. With almost four fifths of all non-formal learning activities of adults in the EU being work-related, it is perhaps unsurprising to find that the vast majority of this was sponsored by employers providing financial support to their workforce in the form of training designed to improve the knowledge of their staff. The relatively high shares of education and training that are sponsored by employers may also be linked to the general affordability of training, which may be prohibitive for many people on an individual basis. A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by men were job-related and sponsored by employers A more detailed examination of these figures shows that employers provided financial support more often to male (rather than female) employees in order to follow job-related non-formal instruction. Almost three quarters (73.5 %) of the non-formal education and training activities followed by adult men in the EU were job-related and sponsored by employers, while among adult women the share was less than two thirds (63.5 %) a see Figure 5. Note these shares also reflect the lower proportion of women (than men) who participate in job-related non-formal education and training, which may, at least in part, be linked to lower employment rates among women; the EU employment rate for women aged 25a64 was 66.2 % in 2016, compared with a rate of 78.5 % for men of the same age. The share of non-formal training activities followed by adults that were both job-related and sponsored by employers peaked at 92.8 % in Bulgaria and 84.7 % in Slovakia, reflecting their high shares of overall job-related non-formal education and training. In contrast, less than half of the non-formal instruction was both job-related and sponsored by employers in Hungary (48.2 %) and Greece (34.8 %). The largest gender gaps for the share of adult non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers were recorded in Czechia and Italy, where the share for men was 15.0 and 14.3 percentage points higher than that for women. The gender gap was between 12.0 and 14.0 points (again in favour of men) in France, Latvia and Malta; even larger differences between the sexes were recorded in Turkey (24.8 percentage points). A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by those aged 45a54 were job-related and sponsored by employers Across the EU in 2016, some 64.8 % of the non-formal learning activities followed by adults aged 25a34 were job-related and sponsored by employers (see Figure 5). This share rose to 71.3 % among those aged 35a44 and 72.2 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 62.7 % for those aged 55a64. Note these figures reflect, to some degree, the relatively high proportion of non-formal education and training that was job-related among people aged 45a54. The initial increase with age may, at least in part, reflect the interest of employers and employees in keeping skills up-to-date, with this interest dropping off as employees get closer to the end of their working lives. While the share of job-related non-formal education and training activities that were financed by employers rose as a function of age up to the 45a54 age group for the EU as a whole, there was a mixed picture among the EU Member States (see Table 3). In 2016, there were 13 Member States where the highest share of non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers was recorded among those aged 45a54. There were 10 Member States where the highest share was recorded for those aged 35a44 and five where the highest share was for those aged 55a64 (Bulgaria recorded the highest share for both 45-54 and 55-64). In the absence of employer sponsorship, young adults were the most likely to undertake job-related education and training In 2016, the share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related but not sponsored by employers fell as a function of age (see Figure 5). This suggests that younger persons (25a34) were the most likely to undertake job-related non-formal instruction without employer sponsorship, while older persons (55a64) were the least likely (perhaps due to a shorter time horizon to benefit from any job-related education and training). A similar analysis by educational attainment level (see Figure 5 and Table 3) shows that in 2016 a relatively high proportion (68.2 %) of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken in the EU by those with a tertiary level of education was job-related and sponsored by employers. An even higher share (69.9 %) was recorded for those with an intermediate educational attainment, whereas the share recorded among those with a low level of educational attainment was lower, at 62.9 %. Job-related non-formal instruction by field of study Within the EU in 2016, more than one fifth (22.6 %) of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within the field of business, administration and law. There were three other fields of study which accounted for double-digit shares: services (19.5 %), health and welfare (14.2 %) and Information and Communication Technologies (10.6 %) (see Figure 6). In 2016, across 17 of the EU Member States, more than one fifth of the non-formal job-related instruction was within the field of business, administration and law. This share peaked at 32.5 % in Sweden and was followed by Germany (28.5 %) and Cyprus (27.5 %) (see Table 4). More than one fifth of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within services in eight of the EU Member States. This included Spain, with a share that was just above 20 %, while almost one third (32.9 %) of the non-formal job-related instruction in Hungary was in the field of services, a share that rose to around two fifths in Bulgaria (38.5 %) and Slovakia (43.5 %). There was also more than one fifth of job-related non-formal instruction of adults given over to health and welfare in Malta and Ireland. Another 21 EU Member States recorded shares that were in double-digits, and only Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary reported shares below 10 %.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Key messages The concept of high nature value farmland refers to the causality between certain types of farming activity and corresponding environmental outcomes, including high levels of biodiversity and the presence of environmentally valuable habitats and species. High nature value farmland is therefore a key indicator for the assessment of the impact of policy interventions with respect to the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems dependent on agriculture and of traditional rural landscapes. As environmental objectives become increasingly important for the Common agricultural policy (CAP) and with increasing pressure on resources, complementarity and convergence between the agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) and the monitoring and evaluation framework being developed for the CAP is being sought wherever possible. Assessment A wide variety of approaches and combinations of methods are currently being used across the EU to assess the extent of HNV farmland. Whilst good progress has been made in assessing the extent of HNV farmland, the assessment of its condition or quality still presents a considerable challenge. Due to the variation in data availability across the EU Member States and regions of the EU and the range of physical situations (territory size, farm structure and systems, predominant land and habitat types), it is not appropriate to impose a common methodology for the assessment of HNV farmland. Use of one single method would restrict the analysis to data available throughout the EU, which would exclude the richest and most relevant data sources, and preclude those Member States which have developed more refined methods from using them, with a consequent reduction in the quality and accuracy of the assessment. Agreement on the common parameters being measured, and transparency and acceptance of the various methodologies, does allow for comparability and aggregation, provided that methodology appropriate to identifying land fulfilling the criteria for one of the three HNV types in that biophysical situation is used. It is however important that in each territory the same methodology is used for successive assessments, so that trends can be correctly estimated. AEI 23 - High nature value farmland is proposed as one of the impact indicators to be included in the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework for 2014-2020. As such it will fall under the provisions of Article 110 of the proposed CAP Horizontal Regulation ( Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 ), associated implementing rules, and the legislative framework for rural development. EU Member States will therefore be required to supply values for this indicator (a baseline situation, plus updates at specific points during the period) in the context of the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework. In particular it will be needed for the baseline description of each Rural Development Programme (RDP) territory, and the subsequent evaluation of RDPs.</td>\n",

Statistics Explained Statistics Explained provides easy access to statistical information concerning the EU. It can be accessed from the homepage of the Eurostat website as well as from the right-hand frame of most dedicated sections. Statistics Explained is an online publishing system about EU statistics which uses MediaWiki technology and resembles Wikipedia. It is a collaborative platform that is used to present statistical articles which together form an encyclopaedia of European statistics, completed by a glossary of the statistical concepts and terms used. In addition, numerous links are provided to the latest data and metadata and to further information, making Statistics Explained a portal for regular and occasional users alike. Statistics Explained pages in English consists of some 700 statistical articles presenting data, 200 background articles on methodological practices or developments, and some 1900 glossary pages defining or explaining terms; these numbers are continuously growing. Reference metadata Metadata dissemination Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX) content oriented guidelines were adopted in January 2009 by seven international organisations: the Euro SDMX metadata structure (ESMS) is a format based on these. ESMS is used to present methodological information structured according to 21 selected concepts; it is the standard for reference metadata in the ESS. Reference metadata may be accessed on Eurostatas website from the heading a Metadata a or alternatively, click on aData > Metadataa in the top menu bar of most webpages on the Eurostat website. Metadata may also be accessed directly from the data navigation tree, or when viewing databases and main tables. National reference metadata in ESMS format has been gradually made available to users on Eurostatas website since 2011. Eurostat also disseminates metadata about some indicators known as the ESMS-Indicator Profile. This provides user-oriented information on the properties of specific indicators, with work carried out for most indicators that link statistics to European policies, such as Europe 2020 indicators and sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Quality reporting In parallel with the expansion of the coverage of national metadata, a new ESS Standard Quality Report Structure has also been introduced. It is the main report structure for reference metadata detailing data quality and uses the main SDMX concepts plus more detailed subconcepts designed to specifically document data quality. It is used for several statistical domains where detailed quality reports are required by legislation from EU Member States. All the reference metadata concepts used in the different ESS standard report structures are also described in the Single Integrated Metadata Structure available on Eurostatas website under the quality heading. User support Eurostat and the other members of the ESS have set up a system of user support centres. These exist for nearly all of the EUas official languages and for a range of languages spoken in the EFTA, candidate countries and potential candidates. In order to offer the best possible and personalised support, requests should, whenever possible, be addressed to the relevant language support centre. The mission of each centre is to provide free-of-charge help and guidance to persons having difficulty in finding the statistical data they require.

The reference period for the participation in the learning activities is the twelve months prior to the interview. The survey focuses on people aged 25-64. A pilot survey took place around the year 2007 and starting from the 2011 survey the AES is carried out every five years. The following information is available from the AES: Participation in formal education, non-formal education and training and informal learning (respectively labelled FE, NFE and INF); Access to information on learning possibilities; Time spent on education and training; Characteristics of the learning activities; Reasons for not participating; Obstacles to participation; Employer financing and costs of learning; Self-reported language skills. Comparable data from 2007, 2011 and 2016 AES can be found in the following folders of the database: Participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m0); Participation in informal learning (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m4); Access to information on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m1); Time spent on education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m2); Obstacles to participation in education and training (last 12 months) (trng_aes_12m3); Self-reported language skills (educ_lang_00). Coverage and mandate Three waves of the AES have been implemented so far. The first AES (2007 AES) was a pilot survey conducted in 26 EU Member States (Ireland and Luxembourg did not participate), as well as in Norway, Switzerland and Tukey. This first wave was carried out based on a gentlemenas agreement between 2005 and 2008 (depending on the country). The second wave (2011 AES) was conducted in 27 EU Member States (Croatia did not participate), Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia and Turkey between July 2011 and June 2012. This statistical operation was for the first time conducted under the institutional mandate set in Regulation 452/2008, and implemented by Regulation 823/2010. This legal basis establishes the collection of data on the participation of adults (aged 25a64) in learning activities every five years. The third wave (2016 AES) was conducted in 28 EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland as well as in Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between July 2016 and March 2017. Regulation 1175/2014 provided the implementation details of this wave. Further information on each wave is available in the reference metadata and in the implementation manuals. Basic concepts Lifelong learning encompasses all learning activities undertaken throughout life with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences, within personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or aim to learn is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sporting activities. Adult learning means the participation of adults in lifelong learning. Adult learning usually refers to learning activities after the end of initial education. The participation rate in education and training covers participation in both formal and non-formal education and training. Learning activities are any activities of an individual organised with the intention to improve their knowledge, skills, and competences. There are two fundamental criteria that distinguish learning activities from non-learning activities: they must be intentional and organised. Intentional learning (as opposed to random learning) is defined as a deliberate search for knowledge, skills or competences or attitudes of lasting value. Organised learning is defined as learning planned in a pattern or sequence with explicit or implicit aims. The learning activities are defined within a classification named classification of learning activities (CLA). The current version of the CLA (2016 edition) is aligned with ISCED 2011. The 2016 edition of the CLA applies to the 2016 AES. 2007 and 2011 AES refer to the 2006 edition of the CLA; however, data between the waves are overall comparable. The CLA defines three main types of learning activities as follows: Formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned through public organisations and recognised private bodies, and - in their totality - constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education or equivalent authorities, e.g. any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub-national education authorities. Formal education consists mostly of initial education [...]. Vocational education, special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system. Qualifications from formal education are by definition recognised and, therefore, are within the scope of ISCED. Institutionalised education occurs when an organisation provides structured educational arrangements, such as student-teacher relationships and/or interactions, that are specially designed for education and learninga. [1] Non-formal education and training is defined as aeducation that is institutionalised, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal education within the process of lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided in order to guarantee the right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a continuous pathway structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity; and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Nevertheless, formal, recognised qualifications may be obtained through exclusive participation in specific non-formal education programmes; this often happens when the non-formal programme completes the competencies obtained in another contexta. [2] Informal learning is aintentional, but it is less organised and less structured... and may include for example learning events (activities) that occur in the family, in the workplace, and in the daily life of every person, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis.a [3] Job-related non-formal education and training : the respondent takes part in the non-formal education and training activity in order to obtain knowledge and/or learn new skills needed for a current or future job, to increase earnings, to improve job and/or career opportunities in a current or another field and generally to improve his/her opportunities for advancement and promotion. Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal education and training : all job-related non-formal education and training activities paid at least partially by the employer and/or done during paid working hours. Usual breakdowns and classifications Educational attainment level Educational attainment level is the highest level of education successfully completed by an individual. Educational attainment is classified according to the International standard classification of education (ISCED). This classification allows for international comparability between the different national education systems, introducing criteria to categorise the education levels into a common nomenclature. It therefore facilitates comparisons across countries based on uniform and internationally agreed definitions. The successful completion of an education programme must be validated by a recognised qualification, i.e. a qualification officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance. When determining the highest level, both general and vocational education should be taken into consideration. 2016 AES was classified according to ISCED 2011; 2007 and 2011 AES were classified under ISCED 1997. The AES data dissemination considers three broad levels of aggregation: Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education (levels 0 to 2 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 0, 1 and 2 but also include level 3C short (educational attainment from ISCED level 3 programmes of less than two years); Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (levels 3 and 4 of ISCED 2011). ISCED 2011 level 3 programmes of partial level completion are considered within ISCED level 3. Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 3C long, 3A, 3B and 4; Tertiary education (levels 5 to 8 of ISCED 2011). Data for 2007 and 2011 AES refer to ISCED 1997 levels 5 and 6. Occupation Occupation is defined as the task and duties undertaken by each worker in their job. The International standard classification of occupations (ISCO) organises jobs into a clearly defined set of groups. 2011 and 2016 AES were classified according to ISCO-08; 2007 AES was classified under ISCO-COM 88. Data are directly comparable for the categories shown online. Four categories of employee occupations are distinguished in the online tables on occupation: Managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals; Clerical support workers, service and sales workers; Skilled manual workers; and Elementary occupations. Foreign languages - level of self-reported knowledge The knowledge of foreign languages is self-reported by the respondents and is categorised in three levels in the 2011 AES questionnaire. The labels displayed in the online tables of domain educ_lang_00 correspond to the following self-reported knowledge: Fair : I can understand and use the most common everyday expressions. I use the language in relation to familiar things and situations; Good : I can understand the essential of clear language and produce simple text. I can describe experiences and events and communicate fairly fluently; and Proficient : I can understand a wide range of demanding texts and use the language flexibly. I master the language almost completely. In the 2007 and 2016 AES, a fourth a basic a level was included in the questionnaire: aI only understand and can use a few wordsa. In the online tables that fourth category is included in the category a fair a. Degree of urbanisation Three types of areas are defined based on population density: cities : at least 50% of the population lives in urban centres; towns and suburbs : at least 50% of the population lives in urban clusters and less than 50% of the population lives in urban centres; rural areas : at least 50% of the population lives in rural grid cells. Questionnaire The 2016 AES European standard questionnaire has the following structure: 1.0 - General information 1.1 - Information on the household 1.2 - Information on the individual 1.3 - Access to information about learning possibilities 1.4 - Participation in education and training 1.5 - Difficulties in participation in education 1.6 - Informal learning 1.7 - Languages 1.8 - Household income National questionnaires a which are based on the standard questionnaire for the sake of cross-country comparability a are available on this link.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Participation rate of adults in learning in the last four weeks The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training adopted in May 2009 had set a number of benchmarks to be achieved by 2020, including one for adult participation in learning, namely that an average of at least 15 % of adults aged 25 to 64 years old should participate in lifelong learning. In 2020, the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 in the EU who participated in education or training was 9.2 %; a share that was 0.9 percentage points lower than the corresponding share for 2015 and 1.6 points lower compared to 2019. It is considered that part of the decrease could be related to the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. cancellation of training activities. The adult learning indicator refers to participation in formal and non-formal education and training and the reference period for the participation is the four weeks preceding the interview as is usual in the labour force survey. (see Table 1). Denmark, Finland and Sweden stood out from the other EU Member States as they reported considerably higher proportions of their respective adult populations participating in lifelong learning in the four weeks preceding the interview, ranging from 20.0 % to 28.6 %. Estonia, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were the only other Member States where the participation rate in 2020 exceeded the 15 % benchmark. By contrast, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia and Poland reported adult learning rates of less than 4.0 %. The proportion of the population who had participated in adult learning was higher among women (10.0 % in 2020) in the EU than among men (8.3 %); the shares for men and women were both lower in 2020 than they had been five years earlier. The participation rate of both women and men increased continuously until 2019 and fell in 2020 only, i.e. with the onset of the COVID-2019 pandemic. In 2020, women recorded higher participation rates than men in all EU Member States except for Czechia, Germany, Greece and Cyprus (where rates for men were higher), while Romania reported the same rate for both sexes. The largest gender difference, in percentage points, was in Sweden, where the participation rate for women was 13.6 percentage points higher than for men. Participation rate of adults in learning in the last 12 months In addition to the data from the labour force survey which provides information on participation in education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey interview, information on education and training is available from the adult education survey (AES). The AES measures participation in learning activities with a longer reference period (12 months preceding the survey interview) and therefore is likely to cover more learning activities, resulting in higher participation rates in formal and non-formal education and training. However, it is carried out less frequently (from 2016 every six years). The most recent wave of the survey was conducted between July 2016 and March 2017 (and named the 2016 AES). According to this survey, in 201643.7 % of people in the EU aged 25 to 64 took part in education and training (during the 12 months preceding the interview), the majority of which participating in non-formal education and training (see Figure 1). For the EU as a whole, participation rates in education and training in the 12 months preceding the interview were almost the same for men and women. In Cyprus, Czechia, Hungary and Italy, men were considerably more likely than women to have participated in education and training, whereas the reverse was true in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Lithuania (see Table 2). An analysis by age shows that the participation of younger persons (aged 25a34) in the EU was more than 20 percentage points higher than that of older ones (aged 55a64) in 2016. Participation in education and training among older persons was particularly low in Romania and Greece. The likelihood of participation in education and training was related to the level of educational achievement: persons with a tertiary level education reported the highest participation rates (64.5 % for the EU in 2016), while those having completed at most lower secondary education were the least likely to have participated (22.9 %). Providers of non-formal education and training activities Employers were the most common providers of non-formal education and training activities, providing more than one third (33.7 %) of such activities in the EU according to the 2016 adult education survey (see Table 3). Employers provided almost two thirds of non-formal education and training in Bulgaria, and three fifths of such activities in Hungary. Among the less common providers of non-formal education and training in the EU as a whole, the relative importance of non-formal education and training institutions was particularly high in Poland (48.7 %) and Slovenia (36.7 %), formal education institutions were frequent providers in Lithuania and Finland, and commercial institutions (where education and training is not the main activity) in Sweden (see Table 3). Participation in informal learning activities Next to information on participation in formal and non-formal education and training, the adult education survey also collects information on informal learning. Typical forms of informal learning are taught learning via coaching or guided visits to e.g. museums. Informal learning can also take place as non-taught learning, e.g. as self-learning or as learning in a group with friends or colleagues. In 2016, 59.7 % of adults aged 25-64 in the EU reported participation in any informal learning in the 12 months preceding the interview (see Table 4). Participation in informal learning ranged from below 35 % in Lithuania and Poland to over 90 % in Croatia and Cyprus. In the majority of countries women were more likely than men to participate in this type of learning. Not very surprisingly, informal learning by using a computer (or similar devices) is reported to be the most frequent form of informal learning in most countries.  \n",
       "3   Formal and non-formal adult education and training About 44 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in some form of education or training Among adults of working age (25a64), 43.7 % across the EU took part in formal or non-formal education or training in 2016. This marked an increase of 3.5 percentage points compared with the previous survey, which was conducted in 2011, when 40.2 % of the working-age population had participated in formal or non-formal education or training. In 2007, this share was 32.8 %. In 2016, the majority of the non-formal education and training that was undertaken in the EU by people aged 25a64 was job-related rather than for personal fulfilment. Training courses, seminars, conferences and guided-on-the-job training are key elements for providing job-related training; while the latter type is usually very short, the other types tend to be of a slightly longer duration (typically one or two days). Guided-on-the-job training is characterised by planned periods of training, instruction or practical experience, using normal tools of work, either at the immediate place of work or in the work-situation with the presence of a tutor. In the Netherlands and Sweden, the share of the working-age population participating in education and training rose to 64 % Among the EU Member States, there was a considerable variation between the shares of adult working-age populations who participated in formal and non-formal education or training. In 2016, the highest proportions were recorded in the Netherlands (64.1 %) and Sweden (63.8 %), while 50a60 % of working-age adults in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Finland, Hungary and Austria participated in some form of education and training. A small majority, 16 of the Member States recorded participation rates between 25 and 50 %, while Greece (16.7 %) and Romania (7.0 %) recorded much lower participation rates (see Figure 1). Adult education and training by field of study An analysis of the instruction hours spent by field of study reveals that in 2016 less than one fifth (17.5 %) of the formal and non-formal education and training that was given to adults aged 25a64 in the EU concerned business, administration and law. There were two fields of study which each accounted for around 15 % of the total hours spent by adults in instruction: services; and health and welfare. Arts and humanities; and engineering, manufacturing and construction were the only other fields to record double-digit shares. Business, administration & law and health & welfare accounted for the biggest shares of adult education and training Table 1 highlights that, while business, administration and law was the most popular field of study in terms of hours spent for adult education and training in the EU in 2016, with eight Member States recording their highest shares in this domain, health and welfare was just behind with seven Member States. Among the other Member States, five recorded highest shares in services, four in arts and humanities and two in engineering, manufacturing and construction (Estonia registering its highest share in both health & welfare and engineering, manufacturing and construction). The remaining two countries recorded high non response. Adult education and training: relative importance of formal and non-formal instruction Non-formal instruction is the most frequent type of education and training The majority of adult education and training in the EU is non-formal education and training, in other words, outside of formal institutions of schools, colleges and universities. This is not surprising given that the age criterion for the AES is persons of working age (25a64 years-old), when most people have already completed their formal studies. In 2016, more than two fifths (41.4 %) of the EUas adult working-age population participated in non-formal education and training, a share that was more than eight times as high as the share of those who participated in formal education or training (5.0 %). Formal education and training was relatively common in Finland (14.2 % of working-age adults), Sweden (13.8 %) and Denmark (13.5 %); all of the remaining EU Member States reported single-digit shares. By contrast, fewer than 3 % of adults aged 25a64 participated in formal education and training in Bulgaria, Czechia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia (see Figure 1). A higher proportion of the instruction given in health and welfare was provided in a formal setting, while the opposite was true for services Figure 3 provides an analysis of the relative importance of different fields of study in terms of instruction hours, contrasting formal and non-formal education and training. In 2016, health and welfare accounted for 18.8 % of the total number of hours adults spent in formal education and training in the EU compared with 11.5 % of hours spent in non-formal education and training. Engineering, manufacturing and construction accounted also for a considerably higher proportion of the formal instruction hours of adults in the EU in 2016 (when compared with its share of non-formal instruction hours), while the relative share of services in non-formal instruction hours was considerably higher than its share in formal instruction hours. In a similar vein, social sciences, journalism and information as well as natural sciences, mathematics and statistics accounted for a relatively high share of the total number of hours of formal instruction that were given to adults, while arts and humanities, Information and Communication Technologies and generic programmes and qualifications accounted for relatively high shares of the total number of hours of non-formal education and training. Focus on non-formal adult education and training The remainder of this article concentrates on the most common type of adult learning, non-formal education and training. The AES provides information on basically all non-formal learning activities in which an adult participated during the last 12 months. Therefore it is possible to analyse at the level of non-formal activities. The shares presented in this section are generally shown in relation to the total number of non-formal activities. Formal education and training of adults is not covered hereafter. Relative importance of job-related non-formal adult education and training In 2016, approximately four fifths (78.8 %) of the non-formal education and training activities of adults in the EU were job-related and almost one fifth (19.4 %) was not job-related; the remaining 1.8 % concerned non-formal activities where there was no response whether it was job-related or not. The share of non-formal learning activities that was job-related ranged among the EU Member States from highs of more than 90 % in Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, down to 55.6 % in Hungary (see Table 2). A higher proportion of non-formal learning activities of adult men rather than adult women was job-related Within the EU in 2016, a high proportion (83.2 %) of non-formal learning activities of men was job-related. This share could be compared with the corresponding value for women, where just below three quarters (74.6 %) of all non-formal learning activities were job-related. This gender gap was apparent in 26 EU Member States. The only exception was Cyprus, where the share of job-related non-formal learning activities was higher for women than for men: 79.3 % against 66.3 %. In contrast, while 90.5 % of the non-formal learning activities of men in Greece were job-related, the corresponding share for women was 17.0 percentage points lower. This was the largest gender gap among the EU Member States, ahead of Italy (14.8 points difference), while France, Czechia and Malta all reported double-digit differences (again with a higher share of non-formal learning activities of adult men being job-related). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to become slightly higher as people moved towards the 45a54 years age group In 2016, the share of non-formal learning activities in the EU that was job-related rose slightly as a function of age from 77.3 % for those aged 25a34 to a peak of 81.7 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 71.8 % among those aged 55a64. While considerably more than half of the non-formal learning of people aged 55a64 continued to be job-related, the relatively low shares for this age group suggest that some older persons were preparing for retirement by expanding their knowledge or skills in non-job related areas (see Figure 4). The share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related tended to be higher among adults with a tertiary level of educational attainment An analysis by level of educational attainment (see Figure 4) suggests that adults in the EU with a tertiary level of educational attainment were more likely to follow some form of job-related education and training. In 2016, some 79.8 % of the non-formal learning activities of people aged 25a64 with a tertiary level of educational attainment (ISCED 2011 levels 5 to 8) were job-related, compared with 74.1 % among those with a low level of educational attainment (ISCED levels 0-2). At the same time, for adults with an intermediate educational attainment (ISCED levels 3-4) a share almost as high as for those with a tertiary education can be observed (78.6 %). Employer-sponsored job-related non-formal adult education and training Figure 5 shows the relative contribution of sponsorship from employers to job-related non-formal education and training. In 2016, some 68.4 % of the non-formal education and training activities of adults were job-related and sponsored by employers, while 10.4 % of the activities were job-related and financially supported by other means. With almost four fifths of all non-formal learning activities of adults in the EU being work-related, it is perhaps unsurprising to find that the vast majority of this was sponsored by employers providing financial support to their workforce in the form of training designed to improve the knowledge of their staff. The relatively high shares of education and training that are sponsored by employers may also be linked to the general affordability of training, which may be prohibitive for many people on an individual basis. A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by men were job-related and sponsored by employers A more detailed examination of these figures shows that employers provided financial support more often to male (rather than female) employees in order to follow job-related non-formal instruction. Almost three quarters (73.5 %) of the non-formal education and training activities followed by adult men in the EU were job-related and sponsored by employers, while among adult women the share was less than two thirds (63.5 %) a see Figure 5. Note these shares also reflect the lower proportion of women (than men) who participate in job-related non-formal education and training, which may, at least in part, be linked to lower employment rates among women; the EU employment rate for women aged 25a64 was 66.2 % in 2016, compared with a rate of 78.5 % for men of the same age. The share of non-formal training activities followed by adults that were both job-related and sponsored by employers peaked at 92.8 % in Bulgaria and 84.7 % in Slovakia, reflecting their high shares of overall job-related non-formal education and training. In contrast, less than half of the non-formal instruction was both job-related and sponsored by employers in Hungary (48.2 %) and Greece (34.8 %). The largest gender gaps for the share of adult non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers were recorded in Czechia and Italy, where the share for men was 15.0 and 14.3 percentage points higher than that for women. The gender gap was between 12.0 and 14.0 points (again in favour of men) in France, Latvia and Malta; even larger differences between the sexes were recorded in Turkey (24.8 percentage points). A higher proportion of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken by those aged 45a54 were job-related and sponsored by employers Across the EU in 2016, some 64.8 % of the non-formal learning activities followed by adults aged 25a34 were job-related and sponsored by employers (see Figure 5). This share rose to 71.3 % among those aged 35a44 and 72.2 % among those aged 45a54, before falling to 62.7 % for those aged 55a64. Note these figures reflect, to some degree, the relatively high proportion of non-formal education and training that was job-related among people aged 45a54. The initial increase with age may, at least in part, reflect the interest of employers and employees in keeping skills up-to-date, with this interest dropping off as employees get closer to the end of their working lives. While the share of job-related non-formal education and training activities that were financed by employers rose as a function of age up to the 45a54 age group for the EU as a whole, there was a mixed picture among the EU Member States (see Table 3). In 2016, there were 13 Member States where the highest share of non-formal instruction that was both job-related and sponsored by employers was recorded among those aged 45a54. There were 10 Member States where the highest share was recorded for those aged 35a44 and five where the highest share was for those aged 55a64 (Bulgaria recorded the highest share for both 45-54 and 55-64). In the absence of employer sponsorship, young adults were the most likely to undertake job-related education and training In 2016, the share of non-formal education and training activities that were job-related but not sponsored by employers fell as a function of age (see Figure 5). This suggests that younger persons (25a34) were the most likely to undertake job-related non-formal instruction without employer sponsorship, while older persons (55a64) were the least likely (perhaps due to a shorter time horizon to benefit from any job-related education and training). A similar analysis by educational attainment level (see Figure 5 and Table 3) shows that in 2016 a relatively high proportion (68.2 %) of the non-formal education and training activities undertaken in the EU by those with a tertiary level of education was job-related and sponsored by employers. An even higher share (69.9 %) was recorded for those with an intermediate educational attainment, whereas the share recorded among those with a low level of educational attainment was lower, at 62.9 %. Job-related non-formal instruction by field of study Within the EU in 2016, more than one fifth (22.6 %) of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within the field of business, administration and law. There were three other fields of study which accounted for double-digit shares: services (19.5 %), health and welfare (14.2 %) and Information and Communication Technologies (10.6 %) (see Figure 6). In 2016, across 17 of the EU Member States, more than one fifth of the non-formal job-related instruction was within the field of business, administration and law. This share peaked at 32.5 % in Sweden and was followed by Germany (28.5 %) and Cyprus (27.5 %) (see Table 4). More than one fifth of the non-formal job-related adult learning activities were within services in eight of the EU Member States. This included Spain, with a share that was just above 20 %, while almost one third (32.9 %) of the non-formal job-related instruction in Hungary was in the field of services, a share that rose to around two fifths in Bulgaria (38.5 %) and Slovakia (43.5 %). There was also more than one fifth of job-related non-formal instruction of adults given over to health and welfare in Malta and Ireland. Another 21 EU Member States recorded shares that were in double-digits, and only Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary reported shares below 10 %.  \n",

to the causality between certain types of farming activity and corresponding environmental outcomes, including high levels of biodiversity and the presence of environmentally valuable habitats and species. High nature value farmland is therefore a key indicator for the assessment of the impact of policy interventions with respect to the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems dependent on agriculture and of traditional rural landscapes. As environmental objectives become increasingly important for the Common agricultural policy (CAP) and with increasing pressure on resources, complementarity and convergence between the agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) and the monitoring and evaluation framework being developed for the CAP is being sought wherever possible. Assessment A wide variety of approaches and combinations of methods are currently being used across the EU to assess the extent of HNV farmland. Whilst good progress has been made in assessing the extent of HNV farmland, the assessment of its condition or quality still presents a considerable challenge. Due to the variation in data availability across the EU Member States and regions of the EU and the range of physical situations (territory size, farm structure and systems, predominant land and habitat types), it is not appropriate to impose a common methodology for the assessment of HNV farmland. Use of one single method would restrict the analysis to data available throughout the EU, which would exclude the richest and most relevant data sources, and preclude those Member States which have developed more refined methods from using them, with a consequent reduction in the quality and accuracy of the assessment. Agreement on the common parameters being measured, and transparency and acceptance of the various methodologies, does allow for comparability and aggregation, provided that methodology appropriate to identifying land fulfilling the criteria for one of the three HNV types in that biophysical situation is used. It is however important that in each territory the same methodology is used for successive assessments, so that trends can be correctly estimated. AEI 23 - High nature value farmland is proposed as one of the impact indicators to be included in the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework for 2014-2020. As such it will fall under the provisions of Article 110 of the proposed CAP Horizontal Regulation ( Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 ), associated implementing rules, and the legislative framework for rural development. EU Member States will therefore be required to supply values for this indicator (a baseline situation, plus updates at specific points during the period) in the context of the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework. In particular it will be needed for the baseline description of each Rural Development Programme (RDP) territory, and the subsequent evaluation of RDPs.  "
