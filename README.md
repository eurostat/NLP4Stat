# NLP4Stat
## Project organisation
- [Software Environment](Software%20Environment): contains instructions how to install and connect to the Virtuoso server 
- [Content Database](Content%20Database): contains instructions how to setup, scrape and load the data in the content database 
- [Knowledge Database](Content%20Database) - **under construction**
- Use Case A:
    - [Use Case A Widgets Demo](Use%20Case%20A/Use%20Case%20A%20Widgets%20Demo) : for demonstration of ipywidgets only, as part of deliverable D3.1. This is **superseded** by the next codes which are part of deliverable D3.2. 
    - [Use Case A Query builder](Use%20Case%20A/Use%20Case%20A%20Query%20builder): Script towards a query builder, still based only on scraped content (the latest version from both Glossary articles and Statistics Explained articles). 
    - [Use Case A Faceted search](Use%20Case%20A/Use%20Case%20A%20Faceted%20search): Faceted search, with inputs from the database (SE articles) except from one file (scraped categories per article - these are in the process of being transferred to the knowledge database). Among others, the code assigns the majority of the SE articles to (possibly more than one) themes, sub-themes and categories.
    - [Use Case A Graphical exploration](Use%20Case%20A/Use%20Case%20A%20Graphical%20exploration). Two applications for graphical exploration, one in R Shiny and another in MS Power BI. See separate description in this link. The description includes links to short documentations for the two applications.

- Use Case B:
     - [Query_Builder_Use_Case_B_v7.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/Query_Builder_Use_Case_B_v7.ipynb). Query builder using content from the SE Glossary articles, the SE articles and [OECD's Glossary of Statistical Terms](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/). OECD's content is read from file [OECD_final_results_2.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/OECD_final_results_2.xlsx). This file is produced by the scraping code [Scraping_OECD_v8_0810.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/Scraping_OECD_v8_0810.ipynb).
     - [Faceted_Search_Use_Case_B_v5.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/Faceted_Search_Use_Case_B_v5.ipynb). Using Eurostat themes and sub-themes to search articles from the OECD's Glossary of Statistical Terms. OECD's content is read from file [OECD_final_results_2.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/OECD_final_results_2.xlsx). The correspondence between a) Eurostat's themes and sub-themes and b) OECD's Glossary themes is taken from file [themes_eurostat_oecd_v2.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/themes_eurostat_oecd_v2.xlsx). This code includes **temporarily** a chunk producing an input file for a Power BI application (work in progress).
     - [Power BI](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/tree/testing/Use%20case%20B/Power%20BI). An MS Power BI application. See separate documentation in this folder.
     - [SE_OECD_Glossary_Common_NPs.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/SE_OECD_Glossary_Common_NPs.ipynb). This code finds common noun-phrases in Statistics Explained articles and OECD's Glossary articles. The objective was to create a common vocabulary for the labelling of both sources. This code accepts as input the external file [Termino V2.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/Termino%20V2.xlsx) which has a manual filtering of the noun phrases found in the SE articles, keeping the most "useful" ones.
The common vocabulary is being used in the [Power BI](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/tree/testing/Use%20case%20B/Power%20BI) application in Use Case B. The output file [SE_vs_OECD_Glossary_Noun_Phrases.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/SE_vs_OECD_Glossary_Noun_Phrases.xlsx) is also included here. 
     - [Topic_modelling_application_OECD_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/Topic_modelling_application_OECD_v2.ipynb): This is a **demonstration code** showing the application of topic modelling results based on Eurostat's content to OECD Glossary articles. The output file [tm_OECD.xlsx](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/blob/testing/Use%20case%20B/tm_OECD.xlsx) shows the closest topics with probability >= 0.3, for each OECD article. The model is new, based on both SE articles and SE Glossary articles, hence different from the models submitted as part of the [enrichment in deliverable D2.2](https://github.com/eurostat/NLP4Stat/tree/testing/Content%20Database/Enrichment) and has a better overall coherence score (0.54). It is a demonstration code because the output only serves to show agreement between articles and topics and is not in the normal format for storage in the database (i.e. as probabilities for each topic and *term* together with the probabilities of each topic per article).
